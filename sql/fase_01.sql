In these circumstances, we put forward a paradigm for \{AIS\} research based on the principle of comparative advantage, which is the powerful economic force that ensures that trade can take place even between parties where one has an absolute superiority over the other. It is our contention that if \{AIS\} academics are to succeed in creating value added research then they have to identify what they can do that the \{AIS\} industry, despite all its financial and human resource advantages, cannot or will not do. And what economic theory indicates is that such opportunities to add value always exist — if only academics are willing to seek them out. We illustrate our paradigm by analyzing three potential sources of comparative advantage for \{AIS\} researchers and discussing illustrative examples of research in each of these areas.

We studied a database made up of 51 European banks whose shares are included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX® TMI Banks [8300] Index. Regarding the factors for the implementation of WA, we considered two feasible reasons. First, WA adoption can be motivated by operational factors, as WA can contribute to increase the efficiency of the operations. Second, WA can also be understood as a part of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy, so banks that are more committed with CSR should be more prone to implement WA. However, our results indicate that neither operational nor social factors seem to have exerted a significant influence on WA adoption. An implication of these findings is the advisability of orientating governmental policies to firm awareness of the fact that WA should be a part of the CSR activities of banks. Regarding the effects of the implementation of WA, our results indicate that the effort pays dividends in terms of Internet visibility.

One such approach is the experience sampling method (ESM), developed as a way to collect individuals' subjective perceptions of their cognitions, motivations and affect as they become manifest. In short, \{ESM\} involves capturing brief responses from individuals throughout the day over the course of weeks or even months. By doing so, researchers can strengthen internal validity weaknesses associated with surveys and interviews, and increase ecological validity beyond laboratory experiments. \{ESM\} data is rich with possibilities for within- and between-participant comparisons.

In this paper, we discuss the concept of ESM, explain how and it can be used for studying affect, explore various theoretical considerations, and mention some key implementation issues.

This paper examines two different \{B2G\} information exchange architectures that reflect continuing transformations that empower some government agencies to do better compliance monitoring tasks with fewer resources. The win for the reporting companies is the lower cost of compliance. Instead of focusing on collecting compliance information from individual companies, the government agencies in this study focus on collecting information on the supply chain level, allowing for automated data reconciliation. Our findings reveal that pushing controls (automated checks) upstream (in company software and data sources) results in more efficiency, higher information quality and reduces redundant controls. The examined architectures exhibit high levels of compliance by design, meaning that many control objectives are by default encompassed in the design. This requires a well-aligned combination of data standardization (using shared syntax and semantics) and automated information processing (using an intelligent gateway between businesses and government agencies).

Communication of social and environmental dimensions of the company plays a key role in the sustainable development of organizations, and therefore should be investigated more in depth. The aim of this empirical study is to analyse the extent to which Eurozone companies report on \{CSR\} indicators, according to the Integrated Scorecard Taxonomy Scoreboard of the Spanish Accounting and Business Association (AECA), and the factors that can influence its use. A content analysis was conducted on the annual sustainability reports on the websites of 306 Eurozone companies listed in the \{STOXX\} Europe 600. The results revealed an intensive use of corporate governance indicators, a moderate disclosure of environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), and a low use of social indicators. Our study also showed that there is an influence of sector, and the listing in \{DJSI\} on the extent of sustainability reporting.

Currently, the most sophisticated resource for handling transactional information is the XBRL-GL Taxonomy, an electronic dictionary of business elements or digital tags based on eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), the digital mark-up language for financial contexts, which in turn has the special feature of incorporating transactional or Global Ledger (GL) information. This study proposes, in one hand, an extension of that dictionary, to incorporate Operational Risk information, and in the other hand, a simple tool to edit and visualise such reports, called BaselMapper, which is tested with a business expert. Since this experimental tool, BaselMapper, was created in 2007 and validated in 2008, till the publication date of this article, several changes have occurred in both its normative and technical foundations. Due to the financial crisis, the Bank of International Settlements has developed a new set of reforms in banking regulation, beyond the Basel II agreement described here, called Basel III. To consult the current regulatory framework, please visit: http://www.bis.org/bcbs/ basel3.htm Operational Risk aspects were not modified. Additionally, a new version of the XBRLGL taxonomy is now available, called Global Ledger, at: http://www.xbrl.org/GLFiles/that still incorporates the COR-BUS module used here. So, essentially, these changes do not modify the aim of this paper, which is to promote the use of XBRL-enabled technology for Operational Risk measurement in banking institutions at the international level. Further research will be necessary to maintain this tool properly updated, with the substantial participation of more potential users.

The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of media and content types on stakeholders' engagement on Western European local governments' Facebook pages. The sample includes 15-member countries of the \{EU\} via 75 local governments belonging to four different public administration styles, analyzing 50 posts from each municipality. The posts were coded into 16 content types (e.g. environment, housing) and 5 media types (e.g. video, text), respectively. Metrics of popularity, commitment, virality and engagement were also computed for each post. Results show that the most used media types are links and photos. Cultural activities, sports and marketing related topics are the most widely posted by Western European local governments, but these contents do not seem to be the most relevant for citizens. Local governments' preferences to different media and content types seem to depend on the institutional context. Significant differences on engagement levels by citizens have also been found among media and content types and in different institutional contexts. This study provides practitioners and academics with some initial research findings about the effect of different communicational strategies on citizen engagement, which are very important factors in order to improve the effectiveness of e-participation offerings.

We do so by analyzing the content of \{AICPA\} leaders’ web communications to members and outsiders of the Institute between 1997 and 2010 and draw upon the concepts of logics and discourse. We argue that the marketing language surrounding the AICPA's “Vision Project” prior to Enron (1997–2001) is not durably supplanted by the language of parrhesia, celebrated during the Enron crisis management episode (2002–2004) – it reemerges after 2005, juxtaposed to parrhesia. This study contributes to increasing our understanding of the institutional complexity of the accounting professional field by suggesting that this complexity is, in part, cultivated and reproduced by \{AICPA\} leaders’ navigation between different conceptions of being an accountant. Institutional complexity can thus be viewed as a resource, rather than a constraint, which provides flexible impression management opportunities. ', NULL, NULL, 'Marion Brivot and Charles H.

Two typical examples from textbooks are the irrelevance of sunk costs and, more recently, the affect of knowing the outcome of a decision or revised budget forecast. Individual differences in the cognitive ability of decision makers to use information can lead to systematic differences in judgments. We identify and label one of these individual cognitive differences comprehensive thinking ability: the ability to think about multiple paths, branches or alternatives. Significant comprehensive thinking ability is likely to mitigate systematic differences in judgment in many contexts. We report the results of a series of studies using a variation on the investment trap (sunk cost or irrelevant cost) problem and a probability revision task.

XBRL GL serves as a metadata hub (to facilitate system interoperability), as a common face to data from different systems (facilitating common toolsets and controls) and as a tool to enable a seamless audit trail, spanning gaps between systems. XBRL GL seamlessly integrates incoming transactions and external facing reports, acting as a bridge, a single, holistic, generic view of data. While companies can continue to choose proprietary approaches, and while the XBRL Specification itself is sometimes used as the basis for those approaches, it is a proper combination of XBRL GL with XBRL for external reporting that may offer the greatest benefit to companies. While XBRL GL has some obvious potential benefits, the risk to companies and to the market as a whole is that lack of adoption of XBRL GL will lead to a proliferation of proprietary standards at different points in the Business Reporting Supply Chain and for different consumers, such as the world's tax regulators, leading to more confusion and burden instead of providing holistic solutions that provide benefits for all.

Increasingly, \{XBRL\} provides the technological foundation for the communication of financial information where there is independent assurance. This XBRL-based assurance may be on the financial statements (i.e., an electronically consumable form of today's standard \{PDF\} or \{HTML\} audit report) or focus on the quality of the \{XBRL\} exhibit (i.e., the instance document). Regardless of the type of \{XBRL\} assurance report, maintenance of the security and integrity of the instance document is paramount. This conceptual paper identifies and discusses the communication, security challenges and relevant research issues when there is independent assurance on financial statements formatted in XBRL. Successful electronic communication of assurance to information consumers should clearly distinguish the responsibilities of management (i.e., the financial statements) and the auditor (i.e., the audit report). It is important to have an integrated approach where the assurance report, financial statements and other reports in which facts in the financial statements are incorporated are inextricably tied at the level of automated data consumption. Further, as much as possible, human interaction should be accommodated. The paper sets out a range of alternatives for maintenance of security on the assurance report. ', NULL, NULL, 'Eric E.

This paper canvasses perspectives on applying data mining techniques to journal entries. In the past, the impediment to researching journal entry data mining is getting access to journal entry data sets, which may explain why the published research in this area is a null set. For this project, we had access to journal entry data sets for 29 different organizations. Our initial exploratory test of the data sets had interesting preliminary findings. (1) For all 29 entities, the distribution of first digits of journal dollar amounts differed from that expected by Benford's Law. (2) Regarding last digits, unlike first digits, which are expected to have a logarithmic distribution, the last digits would be expected to have a uniform distribution. Our test found that the distribution was not uniform for many of the entities. In fact, eight entities had one number whose frequency was three times more than expected. (3) We compared the number of accounts related to the top five most frequently occurring three last digit combinations. Four entities had a very high occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved only a small set of accounts, one entity had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combination that involved a large set of accounts and 24 had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved a small set of accounts. In general, the first four entities would probably pose the highest risk of fraud because it could indicate that the fraudster is covering up or falsifying a particular class of transactions. In the future, we will apply more data mining techniques to discover other patterns and relationships in the data sets. We also want to seed the dataset with fraud indicators (e.g., pairs of accounts that would not be expected in a journal entry) and compare the sensitivity of the different data mining techniques to find these seeded indicators.

The internship is organized and run as an actual accounting practice in which the instructor serves as the Executive Partner and maintains professional liability insurance though the \{AICPA\} carrier. Students, working in teams ranging in size from three to seven, serve as the professional staff. The client base consists of not-for-profit organizations that vary in size and complexity. Services range from limited scope consulting engagements to operational and financial audits. As evidence of program quality, in 2011 the practice successfully completed an \{AICPA\} mandatory peer review for quality of accounting, auditing and attestation services performed by \{AICPA\} members in public practice. Additional assessment data in the form of student and employer feedback indicate that the Program is meeting its stated objectives.

   large companies in the developed world providing a wide variety of
   financial data online. However, much of this information mirrors the
   paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to
   enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called `first
   generation' of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business
   Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a `second
   generation' of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability
   of the data. Documents rendered in XBRL are digitally-enabled so that it
   is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into
   spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the
   need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in
   information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability.
   XBRL consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of
   this technology within the business and government communities. However,
   despite their efforts XBRL has not become widely diffused, there is
   little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have
   voluntarily adopted XBRL in practice.
   The results of a questionnaire survey in the UK indicate that awareness
   of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key
   champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of
   stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for
   diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder
   networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the XBRL
   community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push
   for XBRL is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the
   UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for
   XBRL such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible,
   repositories of XBRL data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not
   occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and XBRL will
   fade and die. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This new score of operational risk is merged with a financial risk score in order to obtain an integrated measure of risk. The proposed integration methodology is a generalization of the merging model suggested in Fagini and Giudici (J. Oper. Res. Soc. 2010; in press) for a hierarchical data structure. In order to demonstrate the methodology, we use real data from a telecommunication company providing services to enterprises in different business lines and geographical locations. For each enterprise, we have collected information about operational and financial performance. The approach demonstrated in this case study can be generalized to general service providers who are concerned by both the quality of service and the financial solvency of their customers.

This paper examines the impact of Internet-based disclosure on the French stock market by analyzing the relationship between information asymmetry and Internet disclosure practices. Extending previous studies on Web-based disclosure, a checklist of 40 items is developed to evaluate the level of Internet-based voluntary disclosure. Measuring information asymmetry by the spread and the probability of informed trading, we show that greater Web-based disclosure lowers information asymmetry in the French financial market.

The accounting literature indicates that the presentation of financial information either within the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements often creates functional fixation where users of financial statements fail to adjust for differences in accounting policy. This leads users to judge what would otherwise be identical financial situations as being different due to the different accounting policies and methods adopted. It has been suggested that the use of digital formats in presenting financial reports may overcome functional fixation. Using an experimental design involving accountants in public practice, the results indicate that the use of digital formats to present financial reports does not fully overcome the issue of functional fixation in the processing of financial information. Although the participants were able to identify and extract relevant information, irrespective of whether or not the information was presented within the financial statements or in the notes to the accounts, the evidence indicates that functional fixation remained when the participants made final decisions based on available information. This suggests that functional fixation may not be caused by access to or extraction of information but by the level of perceived significance based on where the information is reported in the financial statements. In general, the results indicate that current technology may not be able to fully reduce functional fixation in the evaluation of financial information prepared in accordance with different accounting policies and methods.

To gain insight into the state of affairs, we surveyed 210 internal auditors worldwide on the status of their use of continuous auditing. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) we explore the antecedents of internal auditors' intentions to use continuous auditing technology. Employing the Partial Least Squares method, we find strong support for the model with an \{R2\} of 44.3%. Specifically, we find that internal auditors' perceptions of effort expectancy and social influence are significant predictors of their intentions to use continuous auditing. We also find that annual sales volume of the company and voluntariness of use significantly moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and social influence respectively. Additionally, we find regional differences in the significance of key \{UTAUT\} antecedents. Specifically, we find that the North American internal auditors are more likely to use continuous auditing due to soft social coercion pressures of Social Influence through peers and higher authorities. On the other hand, Middle Eastern auditors are more likely to use the technology if it is mandated by the higher authorities. ', NULL, NULL, 'George C. Gonzalez and Pratyush N. Sharma and Dennis F.

To develop structure to research in data mining, we create a taxonomy that combines research on patterns of observed fraud schemes with an appreciation of areas that benefit from productive application of data mining.

The original purpose of financial instruments was to act as transfer channels for funds between investors and businesses. The purpose of financial instruments has expanded from funding to risk diversification. Although certain derivatives and insurance contracts have been around for centuries, the increased volatility in the financial system introduced in the 1970s set in motion an explosion of product development. Financial instruments used to exist to move money through time backward and forward. Although the occasional crash still instills some modesty into the best of financial engineers, instruments can be tailored to client profiles and to an investor's needs and objectives and current portfolio. Many types of exposure can now be priced and traded, and products can often be tailor-made against an investor's portfolios and desired exposure.

The various states and professional organizations are attempting to mitigate investment risks with regulations and methodology instructions, and, thus inspiring new confidence, to kick-start financing, which is the engine driving the real estate market. New methods and approaches are necessary in the area of real estate appraisal also, to ensure that the market value of works in progress could be accurately determined at all times, thereby facilitating the management of risks and reinforcing the confidence of the investors. The author of the article reviews and evaluates the methods with which the value of works in progress can be estimated well, and which can replace the static, simplistic approach currently used by appraisers. While comparative methodology is not suitable to tackle the problem, as the first practical step, in the net replacement cost based valuation approach the Market Value of the land, as value-forming factor, must continuously be examined. The income-based calculation approach can easily be made suitable for the determination of the Market Value of works in progress.

Footnotes, which include important explanations about financial values, have still an unstructured format and are an obstacle for analysts and other stakeholders who want to benefit from analyzing financial statements. It is of interest how data integration approaches can support and facilitate the process of data extraction from footnotes automatically to gain accurate and reasonable analysis to avoid manual tasks. To address this issue, a state of the art is needed to identify and cluster relevant existing methods in terms of structured and unstructured data integration. It is shown that most of the existing literature is focused on a storage level of data integration.

Bringing in guest speakers, taking students on field trips and teaching students off-campus (either locally or globally) were extraordinary efforts that required significant organization. Today, numerous technological advancements in communication infrastructure, equipment and online tools greatly facilitate such initiatives. Outside experts can now visit the classroom, students can explore or collaborate in distant places and professors can extend the geographical reach of their lessons simply via the means of digital video technology. Based on our 2010 Conference on Teaching and Learning in Accounting (CTLA) Master Class, we share our experiences in exploring the use of digital video in teaching accounting and explain how numerous accounting professors are taking advantage of the capabilities afforded by digital video technologies. Online video clips, student video projects, and online video lecture recordings hold great promise for accounting education. We have created a website that complements and demonstrates the teaching ideas presented in this article and that facilitates video integration into accounting courses. We discuss the pedagogical benefits of using video, including those from general education and accounting literature. The article concludes with suggestions for how accounting faculty can keep current with video technology, areas for future accounting research and a call to action for accounting educators. Our work with digital video technology has led to the 2011 American Accounting Association (AAA) Innovation in Accounting Education Award as well as the 2010 Canadian Academic Accounting Association (CAAA) Howard Teall Innovation in Accounting Education Award.

Using 100 top public listed companies as the sample study, this study examines whether these companies have adopted XBRL, consistent with the call made by the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) for such adoption. Such call was made to encourage listed public companies to provide their annual reports via \{XBRL\} and ultimately improves harmonisation between companies and between countries. The result of this study shows that to this date, no public listed companies have adopted XBRL. Such scenario indicates that there could be issues and challenges that have deter the implementation of \{XBRL\} among these companies. The result in this study serves as a starting point for \{CCM\} and other Malaysian regulators to consider the issues and challenges as to why such scenario exists and subsequently, provide strategies to encourage these companies to adopt XBRL.

The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data—data entered independently of the actions of auditee—and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing practice become feasible.

Lean government is a new wave which is appearing as a response to traditional approaches—like electronic government (e-Government) and transformational government (t-Government), and aims at reducing the complexity of the public sector by simplifying and streamlining organizational structures and processes, at the same time at stimulating innovation by mobilizing stakeholders. In l-Government, public organizations introduce platforms facilitating innovation and interactions with other public organizations, business and citizens, and focus on their orchestration role.

Attention to the topic is warranted for four reasons. First, economic volatility and growth in restatements have increased pressure on companies to report performance timely, completely, and accurately to market participants. Second, recent regulations have increased the workload for accountants at period end thus negatively impacting the efficiency of the close process. Third, several \{SEC\} filings have contained control weaknesses related to the financial close process. Finally, academic research suggests that the time needed to complete the financial close process may serve as a proxy for a company's internal information environment quality. We draw upon prior research and conduct a field investigation with corporate financial officers from 22 different organizations to examine the role of four factors – need to meet expectations, collaboration among multiple participants, estimation process, and ability to incorporate new regulations – in the financial close process. Results suggest that researchers should examine further how the need to meet (or beat) expectations impacts management's actions and the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. Future work could also explore how hidden profile task research and technology advances may improve the financial close process. Finally, research needs to examine how ex post estimate analysis may improve not only estimate quality but also the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process.

If they are published free of license fees, they are known as open standards. For a straight through processing (STP) environment, three types of standards are relevant that include business standards, technology standards, and financial ontologies. This chapter focuses on financial technology standards relevant to creating an \{STP\} environment. It introduces financial technology protocols and discusses the value of using industry standards for electronic communication of trade data. Currently, three industry standards, FIX, FpML, and SWIFT, are used for system communication of financial data in the securities industry. Firms build their own communication vocabularies for exchanging financial data, and in order to use industry standards, they must build translators that can convert the industry format and vocabulary to their legacy ones. An insight is provided into how firms contribute to, transform, and extend industry standards to meet their own needs. The move toward industry standards is crucial for achieving \{STP\} in the trade lifecycle, and more and more firms are adopting one of these ontologies for interfirm communication.

As various initiatives trying to address how the underlying business information should be modelled, named and structured are being realised throughout the world, the importance of moving towards a holistic approach in eBusiness magnifies. In this paper, an attempt to clarify between the standards prevailing in the area is performed and the \{XML\} Data Standards providing generic \{XML\} Schemas are presented. Based on this “XML Data Standards Map”, a multi-faceted classification mechanism is proposed, leading to an extensible taxonomy of standards. A set of facets is analyzed for each standard, allowing for their classification based on their scope, completeness, compatibility with other standards, openness, ability to modify the schemas and maturity, to name a few. Through populating and querying this multi-faceted classification, a common understanding of Data Integration Standards can be ensured and the choice of a standard according to the requirements of each business can be systematically addressed.

Drawing on various organizational theories, we examine some of the ways that companies can symbolically manage legitimacy through disclosure. Press releases of a sample of companies that received cease-trading orders were analysed for their use of language. We found that high-risk companies attempted to manage legitimacy by selectively releasing information and by using ambiguous language. Moreover, some companies behaved unethically by using language that suggested a positive future despite the imminent release of a cease-trading order. These findings have implications for organizational and accounting theorists and stakeholders in the corporate, fiduciary, and investment communities. Copyright © 2008 ASAC.

Our empirical results demonstrate a significant positive association between mandatory \{XBRL\} adoption and both analyst following and forecast accuracy. In addition, our findings show that such an association is stronger for Phase I filers than for Phase \{II\} filers in 2010. The magnitude of the association between \{XBRL\} mandate and analyst following is also larger for Phase I filers in year two than in year one of adoption. Our findings not only support the SEC’s requirement of detailed tagging of footnotes but also show that the benefits of adopting \{XBRL\} are realized regardless of errors found and concerns raised at the early stage of adoption.

The new generation of information provision has been dubbed by Chairman Cox, ‘interactive data’ (SEC, 2006a). Despite the promise of its name, we find that in the development of the project retail investors are invoked as calculative actors rather than engaged in dialogue. Similarly, the potential for the underlying technology to be applied in ways to encourage new forms of accountability appears to be forfeited in the interests of enrolling company filers. We theorise the activities of the \{SEC\} and in particular its chairman at the time, Christopher Cox, over a three year period, both prior to and following the ‘credit crisis’. We argue that individuals and institutions play a central role in advancing the socio-technical project that is constituted by interactive data. We adopt insights from \{ANT\} (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 2005b) and governmentality (Miller, 2008; Miller and Rose, 2008) to show how regulators and the proponents of the technology have acted as spokespersons for the interactive data technology and the retail investor. We examine the way in which calculative accountability has been privileged in the SEC's construction of the retail investor as concerned with atomised, quantitative data (Kamuf, 2007; Roberts, 2009; Tsoukas, 1997). We find that the possibilities for the democratising effects of digital information on the Internet has not been realised in the interactive data project and that it contains risks for the very investors the \{SEC\} claims to seek to protect.

In addition, the most up-to-date financial information typically resides in the vast amount of financial-related news that brokers take into account when investing. As Semantic Technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable basis for the development of superior, more precise mechanisms to deal with heterogeneous data. In this paper, we present a financial news semantic search engine based on Semantic Web technologies. The search engine is accompanied by an ontology population tool that assists in keeping the financial ontology up-to-date. In addition, a further module has been developed that is capable of crawling the Web in search of financial news and annotating it with knowledge entities from the financial ontology that match with the contents of the news. Our contribution is an overall solution based on a fully fledged architecture that has been validated in a use case scenario for the Spanish stock exchange.

The main objective of this project is to improve the quality of the core project documentation that serves for supporting the construction works in Spain and to facilitate an efficient exchange of information between the stakeholders in the Spanish Architectural Engineering and Construction sector, in particular their relationship with the Professional Associations and Spanish control public bodies. Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, \{XBRL\} (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of \{XBRL\} taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, digital stamping, delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities. Our proposal can be extended to other countries, particularly in Europe, since regulations are becoming similar in all \{EU\} countries. The potential for spin-off technology utilization is also significant in the areas of insurance, inspection chamber, digital reporting and project management.

To provide confidentiality against the intermediaries along the message path, XML encryption is used to partially encrypt the message. Because the data structure is changed by the partial encryption, the encrypted message is no longer valid with respect to the original schema definition. Thus, problems occur regarding the processing of the schema validation and the data binding by the intermediary. In this paper, we discuss two possible methods to solve these problems. The first method is to transform the original schema definition. The second is to transform the received message. We examined these methods by applying them to demonstration experiment of Web services. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

EXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is an example of IT that allows financial statements to be transmitted and analysed electronically. The international business community has shown strong support for XBRL, with several countries mandating financial reporting using XBRL. However, even though organisations may be required to transmit XBRL-formatted financial statements, users of such statements would still need to choose whether or not they wish to analyse them with XBRL-enabled analysis tools. Earlier research indicates that the individual user's perceptions of IT tools are frequently negatively biased and that IT tools are commonly underused as a result. If this general finding were to be true for XBRL use, it could seriously affect XBRL's diffusion into the business community. The authors, both CPAs and accounting professors, investigate the relationship between XBRL use and perception by surveying 61 MBA students as proxies for nonprofessional investors. Results indicate that although perceptions of XBRL are generally positive, increased use of XBRL leads to more positive perceptions. Thus, organisations promoting the spread of XBRL should consider making access to XBRL analysis tools as easy and widely available as possible. Additionally, organisations that issue XBRL-formatted reports are perceived more positively than ones that do not issue such reports (a halo effect). © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.', NULL, NULL, 'Pinsker, R. and Wheeler, P.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1057/jdg.2009.6', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'International Journal of Disclosure and Governance', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'cited By 16', '3', NULL, '241-261', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Nonprofessional investors' perceptions of the efficiency and effectiveness of XBRL-enabled financial statement analysis and of firms providing XBRL-formatted information', NULL, 'http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-67849122467&partnerID=40&md5=780ba94bba4a2feef05894ac7f0335cb', '6', '2009', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '[vagner:6]', 'PinskerWheeler2009', NULL, '1');

The results indicate that online purchase intention depends on perceived value and trust. The main predictors of perceived trust are perceived information quality and perceived security.

An easy access to financial information has immense influence on actions and decisions regarding investing, trade and operations of companies and firms. The proposed standard – eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) – provides a means to create a uniform framework for representing corporate and financial information. XBRL defines an easily interpretable, machine-readable and XML-based data format. Its flexibility allows for representing business data using different languages, as well as following different regulation standards.One of important benefits of XBRL is application of XML-based tools and systems that enable easy preparation, processing and validation of corporate data. It is also possible to use XML-based storage and query systems.In this paper we propose and describe a concept of soft queries. They provide the users with a human-friendly interface for interacting with XBRL data. These queries are equipped with linguistic terms (such as large, medium, small) and linguistic qualifiers (all, mostly). Such queries are able to provide the users with results similar to the results obtained when they analyse data themselves. Linguistic terms and qualifiers are represented as fuzzy sets. Fuzzy-based operations and aggregation operators allow for mimicking a human-like processing of data. The proposed approach is illustrated with queries executed on an XBRL document.

One of the key benefits noted is the ability of standard business reporting to create significant efficiencies in the regulatory reporting process. Efficiency-driven cost reductions are highly desirable by data and report producers. However, they may not have the same potential to create long-term firm value as improved effectiveness of decision making. This study assesses the perceptions of Australian business stakeholders in relation to the benefits of the Australian standard business reporting instantiation (SBR) for financial reporting. These perceptions were drawn from interviews of persons knowledgeable in XBRL-based standard business reporting and submissions to Treasury relative to SBR reporting options. The combination of interviews and submissions permit insights into the views of various groups of stakeholders in relation to the potential benefits. In line with predictions based on a transaction-cost economics perspective, interviewees who primarily came from a data and report-producer background mentioned benefits that centre largely on asset specificity and efficiency. The interviewees who principally came from a data and report-consumer background mentioned benefits that centre on reducing decision-making uncertainty and decision-making effectiveness. The data and report consumers also took a broader view of the benefits of SBR to the financial reporting supply chain. Our research suggests that advocates of SBR have successfully promoted its efficiency benefits to potential users.

   consists in a web service aimed to ease the access to financial
   information of companies traded in the Spanish stock market.
   In the last few years, advances in technologies of information and
   computer science have allowed financial information to be shared in a
   new variety of ways, being XBRL the predominant standard {[}1].
   Because of this, the institutions responsible for guaranteeing the
   correct behaviour of financial markets, as the American SEC (Securities
   and Exchange Commission) or the Spanish CNMV (Comision Nacional del
   Mercado de Valores) supply all the relevant financial data under digital
   format as XBRL reports.
   These data must be processed to turn them into understandable
   information for the final user of financial reports, such as students of
   the economics area or professionals in the financial sector.
   The student of accounting and finance, although having complete access
   to the theoretic fundaments of the process, has little contact with real
   scenarios of financial analysis and, at best, this information may be
   obsolete.
   Our tool allows the student to get instant access to the last financial
   statements of every company being traded in the market and, thanks to
   the XBRL format, these data are immediately readable by the user in a
   comprehensible way, with no requirements of any tedious manual process
   to insert and process these data in order to make them useful for any
   tool developed ad hoc by each user or institution.
   In the same way, the tool allows the student to apply the theoretic
   concepts of fundamental analysis, such as ratios over debt, cash-flow,
   returns on equity and investment, or some others related to stock price
   such as price to books, earnings per shared, etc. comparing at the same
   time these figures with other companies or with the industry sector to
   which the company belongs.
   The scope of this works includes all the companies traded in the
   Continuous Spanish Market, which financial information is provided by
   the Spanish CNMV (Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores) under its
   own taxonomy {[}2]. This institution, in an attempt to clarify the
   information and guarantee the transparency, split the companies in three
   categories: general companies, financial institutions and insurance
   companies, and so does this application, allowing the student to
   understand the application of each type of analysis depending on the
   type of company, and therefore helping in its interpretation.}', NULL, NULL, 'Rosillo, Rafael and Fernandez-Jardon, Roberto and Pino, Raul and Priore, Paolo', '{5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)}', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '{Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC}', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '{5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI), Madrid, SPAIN, NOV 19-21, 2012}', NULL, NULL, '{887-892}', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '{FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS FROM XBRL (EXTENSIBLE BUSINESS REPORTING LANGUAGE) DATA UNDER IPP (PERIOD PUBLIC INFORMATION) TAXONOMY}', NULL, NULL, NULL, '{2012}', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '[vagner:6]', 'RosilloFernandez-JardonPinoEtAl2012', NULL, '1');

The markets are developed by a GARCH model based on the S&P 500. These simulated markets are grouped by a main parameter: high volatility, bearish trend, bullish trend and low volatility. The inputs retained of the SVM are traditional technical trading rules used in quantitative analysis, such as relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) decision rules. The outputs of the SVM are the degree of set membership and market movement (bullish or bearish). The design of the SVM algorithm has been developed by Matlab and SVM-KM. The configuration for the SVM shows that the best results are achieved in simulated markets with high volatility; also results are good in trend simulated markets.

The impact sourcing model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus has led to the ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce research about how impact sourcing companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact sourcing companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of impact sourcing companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It also emphasizes the role of ‘social’ encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which impact sourcing companies are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities.

These intricate relationships are often complicated by informal and ad-hoc information sharing practices across the regulators. This situation has been recognized as contributing to financial market risks and limiting the potential of smart disclosure policies to benefit financial market stakeholders. This paper adapts an existing framework for information sharing and integration to the complex environment of financial market regulation (FMR) to present an argument for the criticality of effective cross-boundary information sharing to financial regulators seeking to establish robust governance of financial markets. The framework is then used to outline the challenges to information sharing and integration in \{FMR\} and to help model the related information flows. Current literature and a recent study of information sharing in \{FMR\} are used to identify key actors in \{FMR\} information sharing relationships to outline the challenges faced in this unique context and the resulting risk if these challenges go unaddressed. In addition, this paper showcases an example of smart financial apps to illustrate the potential impact of information sharing and integration challenges on smart disclosure policies.

A number of determinants which potentially drive Greek firms to publicly disclose such information are examined, an investigation of the reporting practices of a subgroup of firms which is on the spotlight regarding their environmental performance is performed, while overlapping perspectives for the Greek case are outlined. The analysis suggests that only a small group of leading Greek firms appears to endorse a meaningful business-and-society dialogue as an instrument for stakeholder communication and the discharging of organizational accountability. Most other corporations still tend to treat such practices superficially and in an imprecise manner.

The core motivation for an ontology representation is the enhanced potential for integrated analytic applications that build on quantitative reporting data combined with structured and unstructured data from additional sources. Applications of this kind will enable significant enhancements in regulatory compliance management, as they enable business analytics combined with inference engines for statistical, but also for logical inferences. In order to define a suitable ontology representation of business reporting language structures, an analysis of the logical principles of the reporting metadata taxonomies and further classification systems is presented. Based on this analysis, a representation of the generally accepted accounting principles taxonomies in \{XBRL\} by an ontology provided in the web ontology language (OWL) is proposed.

It is an \{XML\} based computer language for reporting business information. In December 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) voted to require public filers to provide a supplemental exhibit of their financial statements (including footnotes) in XBRL, with the approximately top 500 public companies required to comply with this new requirement starting June 15, 2009, and the phase-in of this requirement for the other filers to be completed on June 15, 2011. The file created using the \{XRBL\} language is called an \{XBRL\} instance document. Under this requirement, the filers are not required to obtain a third party assurance on the \{XBRL\} instance document. The main reason for not requiring a third party independent assurance of \{XBRL\} instance documents is to encourage filers to comply with the \{SEC\} requirement without incurring much added costs. In addition, to encourage the filers to comply with this requirement, the \{SEC\} is not holding filers legally liable of any errors in the filed \{XBRL\} instance documents so long as they look similar to the standard reports when viewed using the \{SEC\} viewer. Even though the \{SEC\} is not currently requiring a third party assurance of the \{XBRL\} instance documents of the \{SEC\} filings, it is in the best interest of the public that these documents be assured. Although there have been efforts by both the practitioners and academics to investigate issues involved in providing assurance on \{XBRL\} documents, these efforts have been focused on the specifics of the assurance process and the difficulties involved in it, and not on developing a framework of assertions. Even the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recent publication \{SOP\} 09-1 provides only an illustrative list of management assertions for handling the XBRL-tagging engagements under the \{SSAEs\} as agreed-upon procedures without considering a framework. Without a conceptual framework, the assurance process for \{XBRL\} instance document would be ad hoc and inconsistent. This paper develops a set of assertions for providing assurance on \{XBRL\} instance documents similar to the management assertions for financial audits.

Drawing on the analytical model by Hemmer and Labro (2008), in which the forward-looking perspective of \{FA\} leads to forward-looking MA, we build a conceptual framing to analyze this convergence. According to this framing, information technology (IT) serves as a facilitator, catalyst, motivator, or even an enabler for the convergence of \{MA\} and FA. We further argue that convergence is a much broader phenomenon than claimed by Hemmer and Labro. It firstly covers the technical and technological domain, including the intentional integration of information systems and software, as well as the intentional combination of methods or standards, extending thereafter to the behavioral and organizational domain with the (un)intentional alignment regarding both functions and processes as well as the (un)intentional convergence regarding both work and roles. The applicability of this conceptual framing is illustrated with a set of examples. We present illustrations of the manifestations and outcomes of convergence in both the technical and technological domain (related to accounting standards, discretionary reporting, performance measurement, transfer pricing, competitor, customer and contractor analysis, due diligence in M&amp;As), and the behavioral and organizational manifestation domain (related to accounting processes, work and the role of accountants, incentive systems, accounting and control in multinational companies, the control of business networks, the board of directors and venture capitalists). Based on our observations, we conclude that the forward-looking \{FA\} elements are often intertwined with MA, and vice versa, and that convergence in the technical and technological domain appears to precede convergence in the behavioral and organizational domain. In most of our observations, \{IT\} plays an important or even crucial role in this convergence process. In the light of these convergence observations, we open several avenues for further research.

One is known as “WGMGM,” which is shorthand for the often-cited principle that “what gets measured gets managed.” The second is the tendency of disclosure to bring about valuable changes in strategic thinking.The next two are mechanisms that work to effect change through “external” channels. One relies on the use of data to enable investors, regulators, and other corporate stakeholders to draw comparisons among companies and industries in assessing the value implications of climate change disclosure. The second involves competitor benchmarking and the growing use of data in investment research.Fifth and last, recent evidence suggests that a growing number of investors are willing to raise the bar in terms of the expectations they place on companies to act responsibly now in the face of current and expected future changes.Each of these five change processes are discussed while citing evidence drawn from CDP's long experience of managing the disclosure process and working with both investors and companies to convert data into action.', NULL, NULL, 'Topping, Nigel', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00377.x', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Journal of Applied Corporate Finance', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2', NULL, '45--48', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Blackwell Publishing Ltd', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'How Does Sustainability Disclosure Drive Behavior Change?', NULL, 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00377.x', '24', '2012', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '[vagner:6]', 'Topping2012', NULL, '1');

The performance of \{KBICE\} was assessed through a series of experiments conducted by using publicly available financial reports from the banking industry as the testing batch and encouraging results have been obtained.

An \{IPS2\} includes integratively developed product and service modules. The integrative character challenges the \{IPS2\} development by steering interactions between people from different disciplines (product and service) within the provider's company. Further, the provision of \{IPS2\} requires various competences. Consequently, the \{IPS2\} provider needs cooperation partners in order to fill competence gaps and to concentrate on own core competencies. This kind of interaction has also to be steered target-oriented. Further, the long duration of \{IPS2\} business relationships and incomplete information about future changes cause uncertainty in the decision making along the \{IPS2\} lifecycle. An innovative method for steering interactions and dealing with uncertainty is the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The goal of the \{ICS\} is the early detection and target-oriented development of intangible innovation and success potentials. It goes beyond the traditional financial balance sheet and focuses on three kinds of capital, namely human capital, structural capital and relational capital. As the \{ICS\} focuses on intangibles, its application to the \{IPS2\} context appears reasonable. The main difference by using \{ICS\} for \{IPS2\} is that this method is dimensioned for companies as well as single departments. The challenge is to transfer the \{ICS\} from the system boundary of one firm to an \{IPS2\} and therefore to a network of companies. This paper gives answers to the questions why an \{ICS\} is necessary in the context of \{IPS2\} and what adjustments are required in order to adapt \{ICS\} for IPS2.

While these changes pose serious threats to the economic viability of auditing, they also create new opportunities for auditors to pursue. Both the American Institute of Certified of Public Accountants and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Task Force on Assurance Services have identified continuous auditing as a service that should be offered. Continuous auditing is significantly different from an annual financial statement audit. A latest research report produced by the CICA defines a continuous audit as: "a methodology that enables independent auditors to provide written assurance on a subject matter using a series of auditors' reports issued simultaneously with, or a short period of time after, the occurrence of events underlying the subject matter." However, continuous auditing would present significant technical hurdles. These technical hurdles could be overcome if certain conditions exist. Computer-assisted audit tools (CAATs) are one of the conditions that must exist in order to conduct the continuous auditing. CAATs are defined as computer-assisted tools that permit auditors to increase their productivity, as well as that of the audit function. Therefore, with the real-time accounting and electronic data interchange popularizing, CAATs are becoming even more necessary. The demand for timely and forward-looking information hints that the continuous audit will eventually replace the traditional audit report on year-end results. &copy; Emerald Group Publishing Limited.', NULL, NULL, 'Zhao, Ning and Yen, David C. and Chang, I-Chiu', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Information Management and Computer Security', NULL, 'Financial data processing', 'Artificial intelligence;Computer programming languages;Electronic commerce;Electronic data interchange;Expert systems;Information technology;Real time systems;Security systems;', 'English', NULL, NULL, 'Computer assisted audit tools (CAATs);Continuous auditing;Economic viability;Extensive business reporting language (XBRL);Financial statements;Real time accounting (RTA);', '5', NULL, '389 - 400', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Auditing in the e-commerce era', NULL, 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/09685220410563360', '12', '2004', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '[vagner:6]', 'ZhaoYenChang2004a', NULL, '1');

Given the high cost of developing data standards and their significant impact on the interoperability of data produced using the standards, the quality of data standards must be systematically measured. We develop a framework for systematically assessing the quality of large-scale data standards using automated tools. It consists of metrics for intrinsic and contextual quality dimensions, as well as effectual metrics that assess the extent to which a standard enables data interoperability. We evaluate the quality assessment framework using two versions of a large financial reporting standard, the \{US\} \{GAAP\} Taxonomy, and public companies' financial statements created using the Taxonomy.

Disclosures are a very important part of IFRS. The type and volume of disclosures varies significantly between the standards. However, nearly all standards have a section on disclosure. Some standards, such as International Accounting Standards 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, as the name of that standard suggests, provide guidance on presentation of financial reports. The matter of disclosures is complex and, potentially, is a confounding one. Therefore it is no surprise that major accounting service firms have issued checklists to manage information to do with disclosures.
