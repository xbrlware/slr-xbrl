  Abstract                 = {{Internet financial reporting is now widespread with most medium and
   large companies in the developed world providing a wide variety of
   financial data online. However, much of this information mirrors the
   paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to
   enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called `first
   generation' of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business
   Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a `second
   generation' of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability
   of the data. Documents rendered in XBRL are digitally-enabled so that it
   is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into
   spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the
   need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in
   information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability.
   XBRL consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of
   this technology within the business and government communities. However,
   despite their efforts XBRL has not become widely diffused, there is
   little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have
   voluntarily adopted XBRL in practice.
   The results of a questionnaire survey in the UK indicate that awareness
   of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key
   champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of
   stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for
   diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder
   networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the XBRL
   community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push
   for XBRL is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the
   UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for
   XBRL such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible,
   repositories of XBRL data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not
   occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and XBRL will
   fade and die. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   context, we proposed a model for using XBRL interactive data during
   financial audit missions. The model requires a series of financial
   reports to be tagged in XBRL format (e.g. XBRL application and then
   uploaded securely on a web portal and stored within a XBRL database.
   Using online analysis tool, financial auditors could perform different
   tests on XBRL data. The analysis of XBRL data has risks and therefore we
   proposed a framework of prior conditions in order to implement the

  Abstract                 = {{Irregular activities such as fraud often lead to recurring, identifiable
   patterns in the meta-information. Such patterns may be automatically
   identified by means of a grammatical rule set which uses compiler
   construction techniques to identify the origin of the irregularity and
   the pattern associated with it. The eXtensible Modelling Language (XML)
   is often used to facilitate inter-operation of applications. Extensible
   Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is based on the concept of XML and is
   an open, human readable format designed for the sharing of financial
   information. Due the ease of editing and modifying human readable
   information, it is comparatively easy to manipulate the information
   contained in XBRL in a fraudulent way. An example might be to edit the
   totals of a transaction or to add a bogus transaction to the data. Our
   research addresses this problem by applying compiler construction
   techniques on the XBRL information. In doing so, we hope to extract
   useful forensic information from the patterns in the meta-information
   which may in turn be used for prosecution in case of irregularities
   (such as fraud). Our techniques can be further applied to other XML
   based applications (such as command and control XML specifications) to
   detect irregularities in a post-event analysis. The paper reports on a
   prototype that was constructed using standard compiler construction
   tools such as Lex and Yacc under Linux. We have used these tools to
   construct a grammar and to compile the grammar into an executable. The
   executable was then run on a set of XBRL inputs, where it performed
   pattern matching on the meta-information in the XBRL input. The parser
   was generated to parse correct XBRL; the `normal' productions that form
   part of correct XBRL were augmented by error productions to deal with a
   few examples of fraudulent actions. The prototype was able to identify
   pre-defined fraud patterns in the XBRL-file. It is thus possible to
   conclude that grammar rules and compiler construction can be used to
   successfully parse meta-information and extract forensic information.}},

   decisions without having to translate financial statements from local

   International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for financial

   aggressive effort to make its capital markets more transparent and

   Securities Authority's electronic system. We describe the process by
   which the XBRL-based data were collected and reported. We document,
   categorize, and analyze deficiencies in the XBRL-tagged filings, and
   inconsistencies between them and the Hebrew-based annual reports. We
   observe pervasive data entry errors resulting in inaccurate
   XBRL-generated financial reports, which went undetected for over one

   consists in a web service aimed to ease the access to financial
   information of companies traded in the Spanish stock market.
   In the last few years, advances in technologies of information and
   computer science have allowed financial information to be shared in a
   new variety of ways, being XBRL the predominant standard {[}1].
   Because of this, the institutions responsible for guaranteeing the
   correct behaviour of financial markets, as the American SEC (Securities
   and Exchange Commission) or the Spanish CNMV (Comision Nacional del
   Mercado de Valores) supply all the relevant financial data under digital
   format as XBRL reports.
   These data must be processed to turn them into understandable
   information for the final user of financial reports, such as students of
   the economics area or professionals in the financial sector.
   The student of accounting and finance, although having complete access
   to the theoretic fundaments of the process, has little contact with real
   scenarios of financial analysis and, at best, this information may be
   obsolete.
   Our tool allows the student to get instant access to the last financial
   statements of every company being traded in the market and, thanks to
   the XBRL format, these data are immediately readable by the user in a
   comprehensible way, with no requirements of any tedious manual process
   to insert and process these data in order to make them useful for any
   tool developed ad hoc by each user or institution.
   In the same way, the tool allows the student to apply the theoretic
   concepts of fundamental analysis, such as ratios over debt, cash-flow,
   returns on equity and investment, or some others related to stock price
   such as price to books, earnings per shared, etc. comparing at the same
   time these figures with other companies or with the industry sector to
   which the company belongs.
   The scope of this works includes all the companies traded in the
   Continuous Spanish Market, which financial information is provided by
   the Spanish CNMV (Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores) under its
   own taxonomy {[}2]. This institution, in an attempt to clarify the
   information and guarantee the transparency, split the companies in three
   categories: general companies, financial institutions and insurance
   companies, and so does this application, allowing the student to
   understand the application of each type of analysis depending on the
   type of company, and therefore helping in its interpretation.}},
