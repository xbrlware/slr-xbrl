  Abstract                 = {In response to successive accounting frauds such as Enron scandal, corporate accounting transparency has been at issue all over the world. After the United States and many European countries introduced XBRL that has been developed as a tool to improve accounting transparency, XBRL is being used as a standard of financial reporting worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to present how XBRL affects corporate accounting transparency. We investigated the meaning of accounting transparency and indices to measure it. We also presented the factors for measuring accounting information transparency, and established a research model and hypotheses to analyze the relationships among accounting transparency, accounting information transparency and XBRL. Last, we carried out confirmatory factor analysis to verify the research model and analyzed the research hypotheses through LISREL.},

Moreover, tools such as XBRL have been developed to deal with the automatic generation of business reports. However the available tools are not suitable to support the current tendency towards the so called, Continuous Reporting. Here, for a specific purpose, the wealth of available information should be summarized in short reports where the relevant information is remarked while the irrelevant remains hidden. Using a combination of Zadeh's Computational Theory of Perceptions and Semantic Web techniques, we propose a first approach to a computational framework to generate short reports that consist of few but meaningful Natural Language sentences. These sentences are designed to solve the user needs in a specific context of meaning defined with the help of an ontology. A practical demonstration of the computational framework is included.},

However, the user may wish to compare alternatives and a search capability should compare concepts and present the best alternatives. This task can be difficult without proper decision aids. We propose a concept comparison engine as a decision support tool that may be used to compare attributes of different alternatives and aid in making an informed selection. We describe an architecture and an interaction scenario and implement a prototype. We propose a number of evaluation metrics for measuring the viability of different terms for the purpose of comparing concepts. In scripted experiments, orderings for candidate terms from the prototype are compared to gold standard ranking lists from structured external sources. Our results indicate that a Rankor analysis may be promising as a measure of the differentiating power of candidate terms a user might choose to support concept comparison. },

Additionally, our results suggest that comments received systematically differ with respondent characteristics such as respondent type, firm characteristics, and industry affiliation. Finally, the complementary use of \{CLUTO\} with manual content analysis and the robust results obtained from CLUTO, provide support for the potential use of \{CLUTO\} to examine large textual databases in future accounting research. },

Account Rev 2007;82(5): 1365–1374] which questioned the direction and value added of non-AIS accounting research, we discuss the state of research in Accounting Information Systems. \{AIS\} researchers face a significant hurdle in undertaking value added research given that the financial and human resources that industry devotes to research and development of \{AIS\} technology dwarf the capabilities of academic researchers. In these circumstances, we put forward a paradigm for \{AIS\} research based on the principle of comparative advantage, which is the powerful economic force that ensures that trade can take place even between parties where one has an absolute superiority over the other. It is our contention that if \{AIS\} academics are to succeed in creating value added research then they have to identify what they can do that the \{AIS\} industry, despite all its financial and human resource advantages, cannot or will not do. And what economic theory indicates is that such opportunities to add value always exist — if only academics are willing to seek them out. We illustrate our paradigm by analyzing three potential sources of comparative advantage for \{AIS\} researchers and discussing illustrative examples of research in each of these areas. },

We use Elliott's (1998) model of decision making and apply it to the governance area to serve as a framework for an investigation of precisely how \{XBRL\} will provide value added. We then analyze the current specifications of XBRL, both its taxonomies and the way in which tagged data is rendered, to answer the question of whether XBRL—as opposed to the generic concept of tagged data—takes full advantage of its potential to improve governance decision making. },

This article updates prior literature reviews by organizing and summarizing recent additions to the accounting education literature. These reviews are categorized into four sections corresponding to traditional lines of inquiry: (1) curriculum, assurance of learning (AOL), and instruction; (2) educational technology; (3) faculty issues; and (4) students. Suggestions for educational research in all content areas are presented. For the first time in this series of literature reviews, we assess the data collection and empirical analysis methods and recommend adoption of more rigorous techniques moving forward. Articles presenting teaching materials and educational cases published in the same six journals during 2010–2012 are presented in an appendix, categorized by the courses for which they are appropriate. },

  Abstract                 = {A growing body of literature spanning the social, psychological, and neurological sciences is studying the influence of affect (emotions, feelings and moods) within a variety of decision-making contexts. Accounting Information Systems (AIS) researchers interested in capturing affect within such contexts ought to consider methods that are designed to capture affect close to its realization. One such approach is the experience sampling method (ESM), developed as a way to collect individuals' subjective perceptions of their cognitions, motivations and affect as they become manifest. In short, \{ESM\} involves capturing brief responses from individuals throughout the day over the course of weeks or even months. By doing so, researchers can strengthen internal validity weaknesses associated with surveys and interviews, and increase ecological validity beyond laboratory experiments. \{ESM\} data is rich with possibilities for within- and between-participant comparisons. However, conducting an \{ESM\} study is much more intense and time-consuming than a one-time survey. In this paper, we discuss the concept of ESM, explain how and it can be used for studying affect, explore various theoretical considerations, and mention some key implementation issues. Our objective is to highlight the \{ESM\} and offer directions for \{AIS\} researchers interested in evaluating the suitability of the \{ESM\} method for their research programs. },

  Abstract                 = {Transforming Business-to-Government (B2G) information exchange is a next frontier for reducing government spending while improving performance. This paper examines two different \{B2G\} information exchange architectures that reflect continuing transformations that empower some government agencies to do better compliance monitoring tasks with fewer resources. The win for the reporting companies is the lower cost of compliance. Instead of focusing on collecting compliance information from individual companies, the government agencies in this study focus on collecting information on the supply chain level, allowing for automated data reconciliation. Our findings reveal that pushing controls (automated checks) upstream (in company software and data sources) results in more efficiency, higher information quality and reduces redundant controls. The examined architectures exhibit high levels of compliance by design, meaning that many control objectives are by default encompassed in the design. This requires a well-aligned combination of data standardization (using shared syntax and semantics) and automated information processing (using an intelligent gateway between businesses and government agencies). However, achieving such an alignment is a difficult challenge; especially when taking into account that such transformations require solid governance, trust and high initial investments — prerequisites that are rare in many public-private partnerships. },

A content analysis was conducted on the annual sustainability reports on the websites of 306 Eurozone companies listed in the \{STOXX\} Europe 600. The results revealed an intensive use of corporate governance indicators, a moderate disclosure of environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), and a low use of social indicators.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There is a very limited empirical research examining the impact of media and content types on stakeholders' engagement on social media platforms, and basically none within the public sector. The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of media and content types on stakeholders' engagement on Western European local governments' Facebook pages. The sample includes 15-member countries of the \{EU\} via 75 local governments belonging to four different public administration styles, analyzing 50 posts from each municipality. The posts were coded into 16 content types (e.g. environment, housing) and 5 media types (e.g. video, text), respectively. Metrics of popularity, commitment, virality and engagement were also computed for each post. Results show that the most used media types are links and photos. Cultural activities, sports and marketing related topics are the most widely posted by Western European local governments, but these contents do not seem to be the most relevant for citizens. Local governments' preferences to different media and content types seem to depend on the institutional context. Significant differences on engagement levels by citizens have also been found among media and content types and in different institutional contexts. This study provides practitioners and academics with some initial research findings about the effect of different communicational strategies on citizen engagement, which are very important factors in order to improve the effectiveness of e-participation offerings. },

The search for new styles of governance which promote higher levels of transparency and the engagement of citizens is viewed as a way of improving citizens' trust in governments. As the social media are becoming ubiquitous, both academics and practitioners need some initial and reliable background data about the deployment of this kind of technology at all levels. The aim of this work is to provide an overall view about the use of Web 2.0 and social media tools in \{EU\} local governments in order to determine whether local governments are using these technologies to increase transparency and e-participation, opening a real corporate dialog. In addition, the paper tries to identify which factors promote the level of development of these tools at local level. Our results show that most local governments are using Web 2.0 and social media tools to enhance transparency but, in general, the concept of corporate dialog and the use of Web 2.0 to promote e-participation are still in their infancy at the local level. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper examines how the U.S. accounting profession, through the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), sought to restore its damaged reputation and re-legitimize its claim to self-regulation after the Enron scandal. We do so by analyzing the content of \{AICPA\} leaders’ web communications to members and outsiders of the Institute between 1997 and 2010 and draw upon the concepts of logics and discourse. We argue that the marketing language surrounding the AICPA's “Vision Project” prior to Enron (1997–2001) is not durably supplanted by the language of parrhesia, celebrated during the Enron crisis management episode (2002–2004) – it reemerges after 2005, juxtaposed to parrhesia. This study contributes to increasing our understanding of the institutional complexity of the accounting professional field by suggesting that this complexity is, in part, cultivated and reproduced by \{AICPA\} leaders’ navigation between different conceptions of being an accountant. Institutional complexity can thus be viewed as a resource, rather than a constraint, which provides flexible impression management opportunities. },

Two typical examples from textbooks are the irrelevance of sunk costs and, more recently, the affect of knowing the outcome of a decision or revised budget forecast. Individual differences in the cognitive ability of decision makers to use information can lead to systematic differences in judgments. We identify and label one of these individual cognitive differences comprehensive thinking ability: the ability to think about multiple paths, branches or alternatives. Significant comprehensive thinking ability is likely to mitigate systematic differences in judgment in many contexts. We report the results of a series of studies using a variation on the investment trap (sunk cost or irrelevant cost) problem and a probability revision task. The findings suggest that comprehensive thinking ability may also explain other common systematic differences in judgment. },

This study focuses on identifying and examining the determinants of successful \{XBRL\} implementation and draws from several bodies of literature: e-government, institutionalism, collaborative public management, regulatory compliance, and management information systems to identify determinants of successful implementation. This study selects four diverse implementations: the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, and Singapore. Empirical analysis follows a comparative case study method. The findings of this exploratory study underscore the importance of program goals and strategic alignment in achieving information transparency and efficiency, the advantage of strategies correlating to institutional setting, the critical need to provide incentives for adoption, and the usefulness of incremental implementation.

  Abstract                 = {Business intelligence (BI) applications within an enterprise range over enterprise reporting, cube and ad hoc query analysis, statistical analysis, data mining, and proactive report delivery and alerting. The most sophisticated applications of \{BI\} are statistical analysis and data mining, which involve mathematical and statistical treatment of data for correlation analysis, trend analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive analysis. They are used by relatively small groups of users consisting of information analysts and power users, for whom data and analysis are their primary jobs. We present an ontology-based approach for \{BI\} applications, specifically in statistical analysis and data mining. We implemented our approach in financial knowledge management system (FKMS), which is able to do: (i) data extraction, transformation and loading, (ii) data cubes creation and retrieval, (iii) statistical analysis and data mining, (iv) experiment metadata management, (v) experiment retrieval for new problem solving. The resulting knowledge from each experiment defined as a knowledge set consisting of strings of data, model, parameters, and reports are stored, shared, disseminated, and thus helpful to support decision making. We finally illustrate the above claims with a process of applying data mining techniques to support corporate bonds classification. },

  Abstract                 = {This study uses Goffman's self-presentation theory to examine corporate website environmental disclosures from an organizational legitimacy perspective. We argue that corporations use Internet reporting and website platforms to project a more socially acceptable environmental management approach to public stakeholders. We argue further that this disclosure activity is often de-coupled from their actual environmental performance. To test these conjectures, we refine and employ a comprehensive disclosure evaluation metric to assess both the content and the presentation of these types of disclosures and utilize a firm's America's Toxic 100 toxic score, a newly developed measure based on the \{US\} Environmental Protection Agency's toxics release inventory (TRI) data, to proxy for environmental performance. Based on empirical tests of four size-matched samples, our findings support our conjectures, showing that worse environmental performers provide more extensive disclosure in terms of content and website presentation. },

Today, businesses have accumulated large numbers of online services that run and reside on a variety of environments.

We developed a new framework, artifact, and performance model with which to address this problem. A multi-agent e-service system was developed to cope with dynamics and upheaval. We used a customer-centric viewpoint with supply chains both upstream and downstream. An implementation was performed to determine problems in its development. Two simple live case studies were conducted to illustrate the model's feasibility and validity. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A core application of \{XBRL\} is to facilitate the flow of tagged financial statements and annual reports, from companies and other entities directly to the databases, web sites, and computers of regulators, stakeholders and other information consumers. Increasingly, \{XBRL\} provides the technological foundation for the communication of financial information where there is independent assurance. This XBRL-based assurance may be on the financial statements (i.e., an electronically consumable form of today's standard \{PDF\} or \{HTML\} audit report) or focus on the quality of the \{XBRL\} exhibit (i.e., the instance document). Regardless of the type of \{XBRL\} assurance report, maintenance of the security and integrity of the instance document is paramount. This conceptual paper identifies and discusses the communication, security challenges and relevant research issues when there is independent assurance on financial statements formatted in XBRL. Successful electronic communication of assurance to information consumers should clearly distinguish the responsibilities of management (i.e., the financial statements) and the auditor (i.e., the audit report). It is important to have an integrated approach where the assurance report, financial statements and other reports in which facts in the financial statements are incorporated are inextricably tied at the level of automated data consumption. Further, as much as possible, human interaction should be accommodated. The paper sets out a range of alternatives for maintenance of security on the assurance report. },

It is not a comprehensive discussion of \{EIM\} requirements and methodology but rather a discussion of \{EIM\} from a business perspective and a focus on the aspects of \{EIM\} that require particular attention in a service-oriented, agile enterprise. Information is the lifeblood of the enterprise. Without information there can be no coordinated activity, no record of accomplishments, no plans for the future. Management of information is a critical responsibility and becomes increasingly critical as enterprises become international and require greater agility. \{EIM\} involves the validation, transformation, storage, communication, and presentation of data to provide information to support the pursuit of enterprise objectives. Data are the raw materials typically managed by computers; information is the organized presentation of data in context that has business meaning to humans. },

It presents a technique for optimal linear \{SVM\} classifier selection based on particle swarm optimization technique, providing significant amount of focus on imbalanced learning issue. It is compared to other classifiers in terms of accuracy and identification of each class. Experimental classification performance results, obtained using real world financial dataset from \{SEC\} \{EDGAR\} database, lead to conclusion that proposed technique is capable to produce results, comparable to other classifiers, such as logistic regression and \{RBF\} network, and thus be can be an appealing option for future development of real credit risk evaluation models. },

A key aspect of the data quality of these filings is the correctness of the mathematical relationships implied by the taxonomy and implemented in the instance document. One quarter of the filings by the initial 400 large corporations in the first round of submissions had errors, with differences reported monetary facts and the sum of other monetary facts that were bound together in a computation relationship. The primary cause of these errors was inappropriate treatment in the instance documents of underlying debit/credit assumptions in the taxonomy. The results of the research have a number of implications for filers, the SEC, \{XBRL\} US, software vendors and the global \{XBRL\} community. },

  Abstract                 = {Fraud detection has become a critical component of financial audits and audit standards have heightened emphasis on journal entries as part of fraud detection. This paper canvasses perspectives on applying data mining techniques to journal entries. In the past, the impediment to researching journal entry data mining is getting access to journal entry data sets, which may explain why the published research in this area is a null set. For this project, we had access to journal entry data sets for 29 different organizations. Our initial exploratory test of the data sets had interesting preliminary findings. (1) For all 29 entities, the distribution of first digits of journal dollar amounts differed from that expected by Benford's Law. (2) Regarding last digits, unlike first digits, which are expected to have a logarithmic distribution, the last digits would be expected to have a uniform distribution. Our test found that the distribution was not uniform for many of the entities. In fact, eight entities had one number whose frequency was three times more than expected. (3) We compared the number of accounts related to the top five most frequently occurring three last digit combinations. Four entities had a very high occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved only a small set of accounts, one entity had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combination that involved a large set of accounts and 24 had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved a small set of accounts. In general, the first four entities would probably pose the highest risk of fraud because it could indicate that the fraudster is covering up or falsifying a particular class of transactions. In the future, we will apply more data mining techniques to discover other patterns and relationships in the data sets. We also want to seed the dataset with fraud indicators (e.g., pairs of accounts that would not be expected in a journal entry) and compare the sensitivity of the different data mining techniques to find these seeded indicators. },

Interactive data visualization tools that allow the investigator to change the representation of data from text to graphics and filter out subsets of transactions for further investigation have substantial potential for making the detection of fraudulent transactions more efficient and effective. However, little research to date has directly examined the efficacy of data visualization techniques for fraud detection. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to predict when and how investigators might use data visualization techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. We use this framework to develop testable propositions and research questions related to this topic. The paper concludes by discussing how academic research might proceed in investigating the efficacy of interactive data visualization tools for fraud detection. },

The Program, which has grown and evolved over the past 20 years, was founded on the purported benefits of experiential learning and calls dating back nearly three decades for curricular change designed to enhance the core competencies of accounting graduates. The internship is organized and run as an actual accounting practice in which the instructor serves as the Executive Partner and maintains professional liability insurance though the \{AICPA\} carrier. Students, working in teams ranging in size from three to seven, serve as the professional staff. The client base consists of not-for-profit organizations that vary in size and complexity. Services range from limited scope consulting engagements to operational and financial audits. As evidence of program quality, in 2011 the practice successfully completed an \{AICPA\} mandatory peer review for quality of accounting, auditing and attestation services performed by \{AICPA\} members in public practice. Additional assessment data in the form of student and employer feedback indicate that the Program is meeting its stated objectives.

  Abstract                 = {The performance of financial decision-making directly concerns both businesses and individuals. Data quality is a key factor for decision performance. As the availability of online financial data increases, it also heightens the problem of data quality. In this paper, a taxonomy is created for data quality problems. More importantly, an ontology-based framework is proposed to improve the quality of online financial data. An empirical evaluation of the framework with the financial data of real-world firms provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the framework. The framework is expected to support decision-making in finance and in other domains where data is spread across multiple sources with overlap but complementary in content. },

At that point in time, innovators had available a limited amount of technical information on XBRL, because it was in the process of development. Hence, their engagement in the introduction of \{XBRL\} was based more on intuition than on in-depth knowledge of the technological advantages to be gained from its application. Further, their support for the innovation was active and not passive. },

This paper examines the impact of Internet-based disclosure on the French stock market by analyzing the relationship between information asymmetry and Internet disclosure practices. Extending previous studies on Web-based disclosure, a checklist of 40 items is developed to evaluate the level of Internet-based voluntary disclosure. Measuring information asymmetry by the spread and the probability of informed trading, we show that greater Web-based disclosure lowers information asymmetry in the French financial market. },

Finally, we integrate the \{DSRM\} into the operational specification of artifact networks and use the \{REA\} literature for illustration purposes. },

  Abstract                 = {This study examines whether, in the presentation of financial information, digital formats address the concern over users’ functional fixation. The accounting literature indicates that the presentation of financial information either within the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements often creates functional fixation where users of financial statements fail to adjust for differences in accounting policy. This leads users to judge what would otherwise be identical financial situations as being different due to the different accounting policies and methods adopted. It has been suggested that the use of digital formats in presenting financial reports may overcome functional fixation. Using an experimental design involving accountants in public practice, the results indicate that the use of digital formats to present financial reports does not fully overcome the issue of functional fixation in the processing of financial information. Although the participants were able to identify and extract relevant information, irrespective of whether or not the information was presented within the financial statements or in the notes to the accounts, the evidence indicates that functional fixation remained when the participants made final decisions based on available information. This suggests that functional fixation may not be caused by access to or extraction of information but by the level of perceived significance based on where the information is reported in the financial statements. In general, the results indicate that current technology may not be able to fully reduce functional fixation in the evaluation of financial information prepared in accordance with different accounting policies and methods. },

  Abstract                 = {The concept of continuous auditing originated over two decades ago. Yet despite its much touted benefits, its acceptance and use in practice has been slow. To gain insight into the state of affairs, we surveyed 210 internal auditors worldwide on the status of their use of continuous auditing. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) we explore the antecedents of internal auditors' intentions to use continuous auditing technology. Employing the Partial Least Squares method, we find strong support for the model with an \{R2\} of 44.3%. Specifically, we find that internal auditors' perceptions of effort expectancy and social influence are significant predictors of their intentions to use continuous auditing. We also find that annual sales volume of the company and voluntariness of use significantly moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and social influence respectively. Additionally, we find regional differences in the significance of key \{UTAUT\} antecedents. Specifically, we find that the North American internal auditors are more likely to use continuous auditing due to soft social coercion pressures of Social Influence through peers and higher authorities. On the other hand, Middle Eastern auditors are more likely to use the technology if it is mandated by the higher authorities. },

Corporate practice was growing more quickly and public practice growing only very slowly, sometimes shrinking. The current paper examines 10 additional years of \{AICPA\} data and gathers further economic and demographic U.S. census data to explore these patterns and related issues. The professional membership of the \{AICPA\} continues to have relatively flat growth overall, and public practice has continued to decline relative to other pursuits of \{AICPA\} members. When the data are split into gender and age cohorts, different patterns are detected and challenges identified for continued involvement in the profession as defined by \{AICPA\} membership. },

Currently, the application of data mining to auditing is at an early stage of development and researchers take a scatter-shot approach, investigating patterns in financial statement disclosures, text in annual reports and MD&amp;As, and the nature of journal entries without appropriate guidance being drawn from lessons in known fraud patterns. To develop structure to research in data mining, we create a taxonomy that combines research on patterns of observed fraud schemes with an appreciation of areas that benefit from productive application of data mining. We encapsulate traditional views of data mining that operates primarily on quantitative data, such as financial statement and journal entry data. In addition, we draw on other forms of data mining, notably text and email mining. },

The original purpose of financial instruments was to act as transfer channels for funds between investors and businesses. The purpose of financial instruments has expanded from funding to risk diversification. Although certain derivatives and insurance contracts have been around for centuries, the increased volatility in the financial system introduced in the 1970s set in motion an explosion of product development. Financial instruments used to exist to move money through time backward and forward. Although the occasional crash still instills some modesty into the best of financial engineers, instruments can be tailored to client profiles and to an investor's needs and objectives and current portfolio. Many types of exposure can now be priced and traded, and products can often be tailor-made against an investor's portfolios and desired exposure. A useful categorization of financial instruments, both in terms of processing as well as for risk measurement, is looking at the cash flows. },

The main objectives of this paper are to (1) introduce CS/IS ontology research, (2) highlight areas of future research in \{AIS\} where CS/IS ontology research developments can be used to address important and pressing issues, and (3) broaden an area of research where \{AIS\} can make unique contributions to distinguish itself. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract One of the most apparent signs of the international real estate crisis is the many unfinished construction investments. The various states and professional organizations are attempting to mitigate investment risks with regulations and methodology instructions, and, thus inspiring new confidence, to kick-start financing, which is the engine driving the real estate market. New methods and approaches are necessary in the area of real estate appraisal also, to ensure that the market value of works in progress could be accurately determined at all times, thereby facilitating the management of risks and reinforcing the confidence of the investors. The author of the article reviews and evaluates the methods with which the value of works in progress can be estimated well, and which can replace the static, simplistic approach currently used by appraisers. While comparative methodology is not suitable to tackle the problem, as the first practical step, in the net replacement cost based valuation approach the Market Value of the land, as value-forming factor, must continuously be examined. The income-based calculation approach can easily be made suitable for the determination of the Market Value of works in progress. },

  Abstract                 = {Globalization has resulted in outsourcing data, software, hardware and various services. However, outsourcing introduces new security vulnerabilities due to the corporation's limited knowledge and control of external providers operating in foreign countries. Security of operation is therefore critical for effectively introducing and maintaining these business relationships without sacrificing product quality. This paper discusses some of these security concerns for outsourcing. In particular, it discusses security issues pertaining to data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service models as well as supply chain security issues. Relevant standards for data outsourcing are also presented. The goal is for the composite system to be secure even if the individual components that are developed by multiple organizations might be compromised. },

A series of nominal group processes involving information technology auditors, \{ITA\} managers, and financial auditors from three different internal audit organizations was performed to generate source data. This data was then coded and analyzed using a constant comparison approach to identify the codes, indicators, concepts, and relationships included in the theory. The results reveal 26 concepts organized into six categories: Audit Organization, Client Organization, Enterprise Environment, Process and Methodology, Target Process or System, and Audit Personnel. Based on the data and the concepts identified ten propositions are suggested. The results are then compared with prior research. },

  Abstract                 = {Prior research has investigated organizational adoption of inter-organizational Information Technology (IT) using the Technological–Organizational–Environmental (TOE) framework. While that research has yielded important insights into the adoption of inter-organizational IT, new technologies, such as XBRL, can be used inter-organizationally or internally. As such, testing the \{TOE\} framework in both an internal and inter-organizational context is vital because the independent variables explaining internal adoption may be different from those explaining inter-organizational adoption. Using \{XBRL\} as a representative example, the \{TOE\} framework is used in this study to investigate \{XBRL\} adoption for both internal and inter-organizational purposes. The results suggest that the drivers of internal adoption differ from those of inter-organizational adoption. Based on these results, we encourage future research to consider whether the significance of technological, organizational, and environmental variables change based on whether a technology is adopted internally or inter-organizationally. From a practical perspective, the findings can help professional associations encourage adoption of XBRL. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Business-to-Business (B2B) interoperations are an important part of today's global economy. Business process standards are developed to provide a common understanding of the information shared between trading partners. These standards, however, mainly capture the syntax of the transactions and not their semantics. This paper proposes the use of ontologies as the basis for standards development and presents an ontology for the ebXML Business Process Specification Schema (ebBP) with the aim of empowering the capture and sharing of semantics embedded within \{B2B\} processes as well as enabling knowledge deduction and reasoning over the shared knowledge. The paper utilises the Ontology-based Standards Development methodology (OntoStanD) as a methodological approach for designing ontological models of standards. This research demonstrates how Semantic Web technologies can be utilised as a basis for standards development and representation in order to improve standards-based interoperability between trading partners. },

  Abstract                 = {In the past, many activities of accounting professors were restricted or confined by their classroom walls. Bringing in guest speakers, taking students on field trips and teaching students off-campus (either locally or globally) were extraordinary efforts that required significant organization. Today, numerous technological advancements in communication infrastructure, equipment and online tools greatly facilitate such initiatives. Outside experts can now visit the classroom, students can explore or collaborate in distant places and professors can extend the geographical reach of their lessons simply via the means of digital video technology. Based on our 2010 Conference on Teaching and Learning in Accounting (CTLA) Master Class, we share our experiences in exploring the use of digital video in teaching accounting and explain how numerous accounting professors are taking advantage of the capabilities afforded by digital video technologies. Online video clips, student video projects, and online video lecture recordings hold great promise for accounting education. We have created a website that complements and demonstrates the teaching ideas presented in this article and that facilitates video integration into accounting courses. We discuss the pedagogical benefits of using video, including those from general education and accounting literature. The article concludes with suggestions for how accounting faculty can keep current with video technology, areas for future accounting research and a call to action for accounting educators. Our work with digital video technology has led to the 2011 American Accounting Association (AAA) Innovation in Accounting Education Award as well as the 2010 Canadian Academic Accounting Association (CAAA) Howard Teall Innovation in Accounting Education Award. },

Using 100 top public listed companies as the sample study, this study examines whether these companies have adopted XBRL, consistent with the call made by the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) for such adoption. Such call was made to encourage listed public companies to provide their annual reports via \{XBRL\} and ultimately improves harmonisation between companies and between countries. The result of this study shows that to this date, no public listed companies have adopted XBRL. Such scenario indicates that there could be issues and challenges that have deter the implementation of \{XBRL\} among these companies. The result in this study serves as a starting point for \{CCM\} and other Malaysian regulators to consider the issues and challenges as to why such scenario exists and subsequently, provide strategies to encourage these companies to adopt XBRL. },

  Abstract                 = {Process mining aims to extract knowledge from the event logs maintained by a company's \{ERP\} system. The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data—data entered independently of the actions of auditee—and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing practice become feasible. },

While pursuing both objectives, governments face a major challenge—to operate in a connected environment, engage stakeholders and solve societal problems by utilizing new methods, tools, practices and governance models. As result, fundamental changes are taking place on how government operates. Such changes are under the larger umbrella of ‘lean government’ (l-Government). Lean government is a new wave which is appearing as a response to traditional approaches—like electronic government (e-Government) and transformational government (t-Government), and aims at reducing the complexity of the public sector by simplifying and streamlining organizational structures and processes, at the same time at stimulating innovation by mobilizing stakeholders. In l-Government, public organizations introduce platforms facilitating innovation and interactions with other public organizations, business and citizens, and focus on their orchestration role. Experimentation, assessment and gradual improvement based on user requirements are key factors for realizing l-Government. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study advances our understanding of the current financial close process. Attention to the topic is warranted for four reasons. First, economic volatility and growth in restatements have increased pressure on companies to report performance timely, completely, and accurately to market participants. Second, recent regulations have increased the workload for accountants at period end thus negatively impacting the efficiency of the close process. Third, several \{SEC\} filings have contained control weaknesses related to the financial close process. Finally, academic research suggests that the time needed to complete the financial close process may serve as a proxy for a company's internal information environment quality. We draw upon prior research and conduct a field investigation with corporate financial officers from 22 different organizations to examine the role of four factors – need to meet expectations, collaboration among multiple participants, estimation process, and ability to incorporate new regulations – in the financial close process. Results suggest that researchers should examine further how the need to meet (or beat) expectations impacts management's actions and the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. Future work could also explore how hidden profile task research and technology advances may improve the financial close process. Finally, research needs to examine how ex post estimate analysis may improve not only estimate quality but also the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An important role for accountants today is to provide decision support to senior management by assisting them in the analysis of large, complex data sets. Interactive data visualization (IDV) facilitates this process by allowing users to navigate, select, and display data via an easy-to-use interface often used as a component of data analytics. Given the increasing popularity of \{IDV\} as a tool for making sense of complex data, it is important that accountants become familiar with and learn how to use this technology. This case provides a hands-on opportunity to organize complex accounting data to create \{IDVs\} for decision makers to use. Further, the case enables students to understand the potential impact of \{IDVs\} on preparers and users of accounting information. Students will assume the role of a division controller in a hypothetical company and create an \{IDV\} to assist the chief executive officer (CEO) in decision making. },

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary Industry standards are created after extensive discussion between experienced industry players and are helpful in reducing errors, managing risk, and increasing efficiency and productivity. If they are published free of license fees, they are known as open standards. For a straight through processing (STP) environment, three types of standards are relevant that include business standards, technology standards, and financial ontologies. This chapter focuses on financial technology standards relevant to creating an \{STP\} environment. It introduces financial technology protocols and discusses the value of using industry standards for electronic communication of trade data. Currently, three industry standards, FIX, FpML, and SWIFT, are used for system communication of financial data in the securities industry. Firms build their own communication vocabularies for exchanging financial data, and in order to use industry standards, they must build translators that can convert the industry format and vocabulary to their legacy ones. An insight is provided into how firms contribute to, transform, and extend industry standards to meet their own needs. The move toward industry standards is crucial for achieving \{STP\} in the trade lifecycle, and more and more firms are adopting one of these ontologies for interfirm communication. However, concern remains over which format to use for high-speed high-volume trade and market data, and firms struggle to translate industry standards to their internal legacy data formats. },

Utilising semi-structured interviews combined with a questionnaire survey, this paper explores the possible implications of developments in e-business audit for financial auditors as a professional group. The findings suggest that the traditional authority enjoyed by external financial auditors is being, and will be, increasingly challenged by \{IT\} audit specialists. The role of the professional bodies, responsible for the education and training of financial audit professionals, in particular, is highlighted as key to the outcome if they are to fend off challenges in this growing arena and retain jurisdictional control. },

As various initiatives trying to address how the underlying business information should be modelled, named and structured are being realised throughout the world, the importance of moving towards a holistic approach in eBusiness magnifies. In this paper, an attempt to clarify between the standards prevailing in the area is performed and the \{XML\} Data Standards providing generic \{XML\} Schemas are presented. Based on this “XML Data Standards Map”, a multi-faceted classification mechanism is proposed, leading to an extensible taxonomy of standards. A set of facets is analyzed for each standard, allowing for their classification based on their scope, completeness, compatibility with other standards, openness, ability to modify the schemas and maturity, to name a few. Through populating and querying this multi-faceted classification, a common understanding of Data Integration Standards can be ensured and the choice of a standard according to the requirements of each business can be systematically addressed. },

Our empirical results demonstrate a significant positive association between mandatory \{XBRL\} adoption and both analyst following and forecast accuracy. In addition, our findings show that such an association is stronger for Phase I filers than for Phase \{II\} filers in 2010. The magnitude of the association between \{XBRL\} mandate and analyst following is also larger for Phase I filers in year two than in year one of adoption. Our findings not only support the SEC’s requirement of detailed tagging of footnotes but also show that the benefits of adopting \{XBRL\} are realized regardless of errors found and concerns raised at the early stage of adoption. },

  Abstract                 = {The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States mandated a new digital reporting system for \{US\} companies in late 2008. The new generation of information provision has been dubbed by Chairman Cox, ‘interactive data’ (SEC, 2006a). Despite the promise of its name, we find that in the development of the project retail investors are invoked as calculative actors rather than engaged in dialogue. Similarly, the potential for the underlying technology to be applied in ways to encourage new forms of accountability appears to be forfeited in the interests of enrolling company filers. We theorise the activities of the \{SEC\} and in particular its chairman at the time, Christopher Cox, over a three year period, both prior to and following the ‘credit crisis’. We argue that individuals and institutions play a central role in advancing the socio-technical project that is constituted by interactive data. We adopt insights from \{ANT\} (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 2005b) and governmentality (Miller, 2008; Miller and Rose, 2008) to show how regulators and the proponents of the technology have acted as spokespersons for the interactive data technology and the retail investor. We examine the way in which calculative accountability has been privileged in the SEC's construction of the retail investor as concerned with atomised, quantitative data (Kamuf, 2007; Roberts, 2009; Tsoukas, 1997). We find that the possibilities for the democratising effects of digital information on the Internet has not been realised in the interactive data project and that it contains risks for the very investors the \{SEC\} claims to seek to protect. },

In reality, this is equivalent to staffing a medical center primarily with general practioners that act as the specialists.

As Semantic Technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable basis for the development of superior, more precise mechanisms to deal with heterogeneous data. In this paper, we present a financial news semantic search engine based on Semantic Web technologies. The search engine is accompanied by an ontology population tool that assists in keeping the financial ontology up-to-date. In addition, a further module has been developed that is capable of crawling the Web in search of financial news and annotating it with knowledge entities from the financial ontology that match with the contents of the news.

Based on these test cases, it is possible to evaluate and compare the performance of matching approaches with a special focus on multilingualism. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we discuss the results of a research project called eXtensible Project Documentation Reporting Language (XPDRL). The main objective of this project is to improve the quality of the core project documentation that serves for supporting the construction works in Spain and to facilitate an efficient exchange of information between the stakeholders in the Spanish Architectural Engineering and Construction sector, in particular their relationship with the Professional Associations and Spanish control public bodies. Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, \{XBRL\} (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of \{XBRL\} taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, digital stamping, delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities. Our proposal can be extended to other countries, particularly in Europe, since regulations are becoming similar in all \{EU\} countries. The potential for spin-off technology utilization is also significant in the areas of insurance, inspection chamber, digital reporting and project management. },

While individuals use these tools in the hope that their training will improve their performance, this relationship is not a given. This paper proposes that an individual's level of digital literacy affects her performance through its impact on her performance and effort expectations. To explain the influence of digital literacy on the intention of individuals to continue using e-learning and their performance, we integrate the concept of digital literacy with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and test our model using survey data from New Zealand accountants working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results indicate that these relationships were significant: digital literacy on users' performance and effort expectations, performance expectations on users' intentions to continue using Web 2.0 tools, and continuance intention on performance. These findings suggest that individual digital literacy facilitates the use of e-learning, and should be considered when examining the impact of the latter on performance. },

At the same time, Open Data initiatives have contributed relevant financial, economic, and business data to the pool of publicly available information on the Web but the use of \{XBRL\} in combination with Open Data remains at an early state of realisation. In this paper we argue that Linked Data technology, created for Web scale information integration, can accommodate \{XBRL\} data and make it easier to combine it with open datasets. This can provide the foundations for a global data ecosystem of interlinked and interoperable financial and business information with the potential to leverage \{XBRL\} beyond its current regulatory and disclosure role. We outline the uses of Linked Data technologies to facilitate \{XBRL\} consumption in conjunction with non-XBRL Open Data, report on current activities and highlight remaining challenges in terms of information consolidation faced by both \{XBRL\} and Web technologies. },

A total of 451 individuals participated in an experiment. The partial least squares technique was applied to data collected via a questionnaire to test the proposed model. The results indicate that online purchase intention depends on perceived value and trust. The main predictors of perceived trust are perceived information quality and perceived security. Consumers' perceived security depends on vendor reputation, website investment, third-party assurance seals, understanding of third-party seals, privacy and security policies, familiarity with the website, Internet privacy concerns, and disposition towards third-party certification. },

In this paper, we examine whether early and voluntary filers of financial information in \{XBRL\} format demonstrate superior corporate governance and operating performance relative to their non-adopting peers. We investigate performance, market, and structure-related firm variables. Our results suggest that corporate governance is significantly and positively associated with a firm's decision to be an early and voluntary filer of financial information in \{XBRL\} format. At the same time, firm performance factors including liquidity and firm size are also associated with the early and voluntary \{XBRL\} filing decision. Our findings should be particularly interesting for the SEC, as it considers the corporate governance and firm-performance related associations between certain registrants' early and voluntary response and its call for XBRL-based filings. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Impact sourcing – the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing jobs to marginalized individuals – is an important emerging social innovation in the outsourcing industry. The impact sourcing model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus has led to the ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce research about how impact sourcing companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact sourcing companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of impact sourcing companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It also emphasizes the role of ‘social’ encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which impact sourcing companies are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The governance of financial markets in the U.S. is structured around financial products which in some cases results in overlapping regulatory responsibility, intricate and complicated relationships among the various parties and role confusion. These intricate relationships are often complicated by informal and ad-hoc information sharing practices across the regulators. This situation has been recognized as contributing to financial market risks and limiting the potential of smart disclosure policies to benefit financial market stakeholders. This paper adapts an existing framework for information sharing and integration to the complex environment of financial market regulation (FMR) to present an argument for the criticality of effective cross-boundary information sharing to financial regulators seeking to establish robust governance of financial markets. The framework is then used to outline the challenges to information sharing and integration in \{FMR\} and to help model the related information flows. Current literature and a recent study of information sharing in \{FMR\} are used to identify key actors in \{FMR\} information sharing relationships to outline the challenges faced in this unique context and the resulting risk if these challenges go unaddressed. In addition, this paper showcases an example of smart financial apps to illustrate the potential impact of information sharing and integration challenges on smart disclosure policies. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An increasing number of business organizations around the world engage in the accounting for and reporting on non-financial aspects of performance, mainly within the domains of social and environmental responsibility. Using a composite disclosure index this study investigates the status of the non-financial disclosure practices of the top 100 companies operating in Greece. A number of determinants which potentially drive Greek firms to publicly disclose such information are examined, an investigation of the reporting practices of a subgroup of firms which is on the spotlight regarding their environmental performance is performed, while overlapping perspectives for the Greek case are outlined. The analysis suggests that only a small group of leading Greek firms appears to endorse a meaningful business-and-society dialogue as an instrument for stakeholder communication and the discharging of organizational accountability. Most other corporations still tend to treat such practices superficially and in an imprecise manner. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we discuss the motivation and the fundamentals of an ontology representation of business reporting data and metadata structures as defined in the eXtensible business reporting language (XBRL) standard. The core motivation for an ontology representation is the enhanced potential for integrated analytic applications that build on quantitative reporting data combined with structured and unstructured data from additional sources. Applications of this kind will enable significant enhancements in regulatory compliance management, as they enable business analytics combined with inference engines for statistical, but also for logical inferences. In order to define a suitable ontology representation of business reporting language structures, an analysis of the logical principles of the reporting metadata taxonomies and further classification systems is presented. Based on this analysis, a representation of the generally accepted accounting principles taxonomies in \{XBRL\} by an ontology provided in the web ontology language (OWL) is proposed. An additional advantage of this representation is its compliance with the recent ontology definition metamodel (ODM) standard issued by OMG. },

  Abstract                 = {\{XBRL\} stands for extensible business reporting language. It is an \{XML\} based computer language for reporting business information. In December 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) voted to require public filers to provide a supplemental exhibit of their financial statements (including footnotes) in XBRL, with the approximately top 500 public companies required to comply with this new requirement starting June 15, 2009, and the phase-in of this requirement for the other filers to be completed on June 15, 2011. The file created using the \{XRBL\} language is called an \{XBRL\} instance document. Under this requirement, the filers are not required to obtain a third party assurance on the \{XBRL\} instance document. The main reason for not requiring a third party independent assurance of \{XBRL\} instance documents is to encourage filers to comply with the \{SEC\} requirement without incurring much added costs. In addition, to encourage the filers to comply with this requirement, the \{SEC\} is not holding filers legally liable of any errors in the filed \{XBRL\} instance documents so long as they look similar to the standard reports when viewed using the \{SEC\} viewer. Even though the \{SEC\} is not currently requiring a third party assurance of the \{XBRL\} instance documents of the \{SEC\} filings, it is in the best interest of the public that these documents be assured. Although there have been efforts by both the practitioners and academics to investigate issues involved in providing assurance on \{XBRL\} documents, these efforts have been focused on the specifics of the assurance process and the difficulties involved in it, and not on developing a framework of assertions. Even the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recent publication \{SOP\} 09-1 provides only an illustrative list of management assertions for handling the XBRL-tagging engagements under the \{SSAEs\} as agreed-upon procedures without considering a framework. Without a conceptual framework, the assurance process for \{XBRL\} instance document would be ad hoc and inconsistent. This paper develops a set of assertions for providing assurance on \{XBRL\} instance documents similar to the management assertions for financial audits. Further, we discuss how such a framework would assist auditors in planning and evaluating such an engagement by collecting appropriate items of evidence pertaining to specific assertions to form an opinion whether the instance document is a true representation of the standard format (i.e., \{ASCII\} or HTML) document. We also discuss how the use of new technology would make the assurance process more effective and efficient. },

  Abstract                 = {The importance of information technology (IT) auditing has grown with increased reliance on \{IT\} for business operations and new regulations regarding the assurance of \{IT\} for these operations. Prior work on \{IT\} and financial auditing has suggested several general frameworks that may affect \{IT\} audit quality; however, the prior work has not provided measurable constructs nor has it considered whether these proposed constructs are the same or different. Building on prior work that has proposed frameworks of \{IT\} audit quality, we identify and evaluate potential constructs suggested by these frameworks as well as financial auditing literature. We develop a survey tool and ask \{IT\} and financial accounting practitioners to assess the impact of these items on \{IT\} audit quality. A factor analysis is used to refine the set of \{IT\} audit quality factors identified, and we are able to provide insight into the prioritized impact of each factor on \{IT\} audit quality. In comparison to prior research, we find that additional factors are significant for \{IT\} audit quality and that the relative importance of the factors for \{IT\} audit quality differs for \{IT\} versus financial auditors. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this article we theorize and conceptualize the recent convergence of management accounting (MA) and financial accounting (FA) with the advancements in information technology (IT), and explicate not only how this convergence is manifested in the technical and technological domain, but also how it is reflected in their convergence at the behavioral and organizational level. Drawing on the analytical model by Hemmer and Labro (2008), in which the forward-looking perspective of \{FA\} leads to forward-looking MA, we build a conceptual framing to analyze this convergence. According to this framing, information technology (IT) serves as a facilitator, catalyst, motivator, or even an enabler for the convergence of \{MA\} and FA. We further argue that convergence is a much broader phenomenon than claimed by Hemmer and Labro. It firstly covers the technical and technological domain, including the intentional integration of information systems and software, as well as the intentional combination of methods or standards, extending thereafter to the behavioral and organizational domain with the (un)intentional alignment regarding both functions and processes as well as the (un)intentional convergence regarding both work and roles. The applicability of this conceptual framing is illustrated with a set of examples. We present illustrations of the manifestations and outcomes of convergence in both the technical and technological domain (related to accounting standards, discretionary reporting, performance measurement, transfer pricing, competitor, customer and contractor analysis, due diligence in M&amp;As), and the behavioral and organizational manifestation domain (related to accounting processes, work and the role of accountants, incentive systems, accounting and control in multinational companies, the control of business networks, the board of directors and venture capitalists). Based on our observations, we conclude that the forward-looking \{FA\} elements are often intertwined with MA, and vice versa, and that convergence in the technical and technological domain appears to precede convergence in the behavioral and organizational domain. In most of our observations, \{IT\} plays an important or even crucial role in this convergence process. In the light of these convergence observations, we open several avenues for further research. },

Traditionally, enterprises require financial or non-financial reporting based on quarterly and annual periods. Yet, the rapid change that occurs on market and society causes this periodic reporting to become quickly outdated. Higher competition among enterprises demands for more updated information to enable management to rapidly adapt to opportunities and answer problems. Real-time accounting addresses these needs, but needs new technological answers. In this article we present some technologies which can help the implementation of real-time accounting, namely, business process management, mobile devices, cloud computing, business intelligence, enterprise architecture and enterprise application integration. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for the identification of an organization’s intellectual capital (IC) for decision support and providing important managerial insights in knowledge-intensive industries. In traditional approaches, identification of an organization’s \{IC\} is usually done manually through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc. These methods are labor and time intensive and the quality of the results is highly dependent on, among other things, the experience of the investigators. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Intellectual Capital Extraction (KBICE) algorithm which incorporates the technologies of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic processing of unstructured data and extraction of important IC-related information. The performance of \{KBICE\} was assessed through a series of experiments conducted by using publicly available financial reports from the banking industry as the testing batch and encouraging results have been obtained. The results showed that, through the use of hybrid intelligent matching strategies, it is possible to extract commonly referred IC-related information from unstructured data automatically. \{IC\} information analyst can rely on this method as an additional mean to identify and extract the commonly sought \{IC\} information from financial reports in a fast, systematic and reliable manner. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Industrial product service systems (IPS2) are holistic, innovative and customer individual problem solutions. An \{IPS2\} includes integratively developed product and service modules. The integrative character challenges the \{IPS2\} development by steering interactions between people from different disciplines (product and service) within the provider's company. Further, the provision of \{IPS2\} requires various competences. Consequently, the \{IPS2\} provider needs cooperation partners in order to fill competence gaps and to concentrate on own core competencies. This kind of interaction has also to be steered target-oriented. Further, the long duration of \{IPS2\} business relationships and incomplete information about future changes cause uncertainty in the decision making along the \{IPS2\} lifecycle. An innovative method for steering interactions and dealing with uncertainty is the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The goal of the \{ICS\} is the early detection and target-oriented development of intangible innovation and success potentials. It goes beyond the traditional financial balance sheet and focuses on three kinds of capital, namely human capital, structural capital and relational capital. As the \{ICS\} focuses on intangibles, its application to the \{IPS2\} context appears reasonable. The main difference by using \{ICS\} for \{IPS2\} is that this method is dimensioned for companies as well as single departments. The challenge is to transfer the \{ICS\} from the system boundary of one firm to an \{IPS2\} and therefore to a network of companies. This paper gives answers to the questions why an \{ICS\} is necessary in the context of \{IPS2\} and what adjustments are required in order to adapt \{ICS\} for IPS2. },

  Abstract                 = {Recent focus on the diversity of research methodologies available to accounting information systems (AIS) scholars has led researchers to suggest the Delphi method has reached the limits of its usefulness. Using a review of the accounting and information systems literature, we suggest such a finding is premature for the \{AIS\} discipline. The Delphi method is especially useful in reducing ambiguity through the use of expert panels of both practitioners and experts and informing relevant and timely issues facing organizations. In essence, the Delphi method has potential to provide both rigor and relevance to \{AIS\} researchers. Our purpose is to review the prior literature on the use of the Delphi method and discuss potential areas of research within the \{AIS\} discipline where the method might add value. Based on this review, we develop a series of guidelines on how to properly develop, administer, and assess panel responses and then use an illustrative study example that explores \{IT\} risks in operations. We conclude with a discussion of the value of the Delphi method and provide insight into its limitations. },

  Abstract                 = {To fully exploit the capabilities of complex technologies, businesses must deliberately foster technology acceptance by end users. This deliberate activity must recognize the complexity of factors that influence individuals’ perceptions, intentions, and usage of information technology. This study surveyed 66 professionally autonomous end users and gathered information on their perceptions related to several technology acceptance factors for a newly installed enterprise resource planning (ERP) system component. Study analyses focused on end user perceptions of \{ERP\} component usefulness, their intention to use the system, and self-reported usage of a system component. Valuable insights into the perceptions of professional end users toward a component of a complex technology were gained. Recommendations based upon the results of this study include: (a) clearly describe, early in the implementation process, an overall picture of the \{ERP\} system flow and visually show end users how the components they use “fit” into the whole system; (b) convert ERP-related “tech talk” to common end user language by either clear explanation of unique terms or associations of new terms to ones commonly understood by end users, and (c) provide adequate resources (financial, physical, human, etc.) to ensure that end users have access to timely support. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Data standards are often used by multiple organizations to produce and exchange data. Given the high cost of developing data standards and their significant impact on the interoperability of data produced using the standards, the quality of data standards must be systematically measured. We develop a framework for systematically assessing the quality of large-scale data standards using automated tools. It consists of metrics for intrinsic and contextual quality dimensions, as well as effectual metrics that assess the extent to which a standard enables data interoperability. We evaluate the quality assessment framework using two versions of a large financial reporting standard, the \{US\} \{GAAP\} Taxonomy, and public companies' financial statements created using the Taxonomy. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the framework. Findings from the evaluation also offer valuable insights to decision makers who develop and improve data standards, select and adopt data standards, or consume standards-based data. },

  Abstract                 = {{Internet financial reporting is now widespread with most medium and
   large companies in the developed world providing a wide variety of
   financial data online. However, much of this information mirrors the
   paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to
   enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called `first
   generation' of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business
   Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a `second
   generation' of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability
   of the data. Documents rendered in XBRL are digitally-enabled so that it
   is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into
   spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the
   need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in
   information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability.
   XBRL consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of
   this technology within the business and government communities. However,
   despite their efforts XBRL has not become widely diffused, there is
   little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have
   voluntarily adopted XBRL in practice.
   The results of a questionnaire survey in the UK indicate that awareness
   of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key
   champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of
   stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for
   diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder
   networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the XBRL
   community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push
   for XBRL is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the
   UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for
   XBRL such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible,
   repositories of XBRL data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not
   occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and XBRL will
   fade and die. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the work of financial auditors and in which conditions. Most of the
   authors agree that XBRL could play an important role in financial audit
   and continuous audit. We turned our attention to the current state of
   XBRL implementation in Romania, a provisional jurisdiction which is
   currently examining ways of implementation for XBRL standard. In this
   context, we proposed a model for using XBRL interactive data during
   financial audit missions. The model requires a series of financial
   reports to be tagged in XBRL format (e.g. XBRL application and then
   uploaded securely on a web portal and stored within a XBRL database.
   Using online analysis tool, financial auditors could perform different
   tests on XBRL data. The analysis of XBRL data has risks and therefore we
   proposed a framework of prior conditions in order to implement the
   model. The paper contributes to the current need of examining how could
   be implemented XBRL in Romania in order to deliver added value for all
   users of financial information.}},

   companies, and make it geared to international standards, this paper
   introduced the developing history of the XBRL, and summarized the
   advantages in online financial report by comparing with the current
   Word, Excel, PDF, HTML network financial report formats. In addition, it
   analyzed all the efforts and further measures that we have made to
   popularize the XBRL- based online financial report in China, and took a

  Abstract                 = {{Irregular activities such as fraud often lead to recurring, identifiable
   patterns in the meta-information. Such patterns may be automatically
   identified by means of a grammatical rule set which uses compiler
   construction techniques to identify the origin of the irregularity and
   the pattern associated with it. The eXtensible Modelling Language (XML)
   is often used to facilitate inter-operation of applications. Extensible
   Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is based on the concept of XML and is
   an open, human readable format designed for the sharing of financial
   information. Due the ease of editing and modifying human readable
   information, it is comparatively easy to manipulate the information
   contained in XBRL in a fraudulent way. An example might be to edit the
   totals of a transaction or to add a bogus transaction to the data. Our
   research addresses this problem by applying compiler construction
   techniques on the XBRL information. In doing so, we hope to extract
   useful forensic information from the patterns in the meta-information
   which may in turn be used for prosecution in case of irregularities
   (such as fraud). Our techniques can be further applied to other XML
   based applications (such as command and control XML specifications) to
   detect irregularities in a post-event analysis. The paper reports on a
   prototype that was constructed using standard compiler construction
   tools such as Lex and Yacc under Linux. We have used these tools to
   construct a grammar and to compile the grammar into an executable. The
   executable was then run on a set of XBRL inputs, where it performed
   pattern matching on the meta-information in the XBRL input. The parser
   was generated to parse correct XBRL; the `normal' productions that form
   part of correct XBRL were augmented by error productions to deal with a
   few examples of fraudulent actions. The prototype was able to identify
   pre-defined fraud patterns in the XBRL-file. It is thus possible to
   conclude that grammar rules and compiler construction can be used to
   successfully parse meta-information and extract forensic information.}},

   revolutionizing business reporting around the world. It is a tool to
   bridge potential language barriers and unify financial reporting. This
   has appeal to foreign investors, among others, who can rely on
   information in XBRL-tagged financial reports to make investment
   decisions without having to translate financial statements from local
   language. In 2008, Israel required most public companies to adopt
   International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for financial
   reporting and to use XBRL-tagged reporting format, as part of an
   aggressive effort to make its capital markets more transparent and
   attractive for foreign investors. In this paper, we study all Israeli
   public companies and analyze the accuracy and reliability of their
   XBRL-tagged financial statements that are available on MAGNA, the Israel
   Securities Authority's electronic system. We describe the process by
   which the XBRL-based data were collected and reported. We document,
   categorize, and analyze deficiencies in the XBRL-tagged filings, and
   inconsistencies between them and the Hebrew-based annual reports. We
   observe pervasive data entry errors resulting in inaccurate
   XBRL-generated financial reports, which went undetected for over one
   year. Further, first year XBRL reporting (in conjunction with IFRS
   adoption) did not increase foreign investment in the Israeli capital
   markets. This analysis allows us to better understand the benefits and
   challenges of the adoption of XBRL.}},

   consists in a web service aimed to ease the access to financial
   information of companies traded in the Spanish stock market.
   In the last few years, advances in technologies of information and
   computer science have allowed financial information to be shared in a
   new variety of ways, being XBRL the predominant standard {[}1].
   Because of this, the institutions responsible for guaranteeing the
   correct behaviour of financial markets, as the American SEC (Securities
   and Exchange Commission) or the Spanish CNMV (Comision Nacional del
   Mercado de Valores) supply all the relevant financial data under digital
   format as XBRL reports.
   These data must be processed to turn them into understandable
   information for the final user of financial reports, such as students of
   the economics area or professionals in the financial sector.
   The student of accounting and finance, although having complete access
   to the theoretic fundaments of the process, has little contact with real
   scenarios of financial analysis and, at best, this information may be
   obsolete.
   Our tool allows the student to get instant access to the last financial
   statements of every company being traded in the market and, thanks to
   the XBRL format, these data are immediately readable by the user in a
   comprehensible way, with no requirements of any tedious manual process
   to insert and process these data in order to make them useful for any
   tool developed ad hoc by each user or institution.
   In the same way, the tool allows the student to apply the theoretic
   concepts of fundamental analysis, such as ratios over debt, cash-flow,
   returns on equity and investment, or some others related to stock price
   such as price to books, earnings per shared, etc. comparing at the same
   time these figures with other companies or with the industry sector to
   which the company belongs.
   The scope of this works includes all the companies traded in the
   Continuous Spanish Market, which financial information is provided by
   the Spanish CNMV (Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores) under its
   own taxonomy {[}2]. This institution, in an attempt to clarify the
   information and guarantee the transparency, split the companies in three
   categories: general companies, financial institutions and insurance
   companies, and so does this application, allowing the student to
   understand the application of each type of analysis depending on the
   type of company, and therefore helping in its interpretation.}},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter discusses the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) disclosures and provides a review of related checklists. Disclosures are a very important part of IFRS. The type and volume of disclosures varies significantly between the standards. However, nearly all standards have a section on disclosure. Some standards, such as International Accounting Standards 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, as the name of that standard suggests, provide guidance on presentation of financial reports. The matter of disclosures is complex and, potentially, is a confounding one. Therefore it is no surprise that major accounting service firms have issued checklists to manage information to do with disclosures. Effectively, disclosure checklists are a tool for auditors and were developed, originally, to make sure that auditors did not miss anything when conducting audits. In addition, such checklists are valuable when used as evidence, such as in potential law suits, to show that auditors have done the work.},

Any void created by these retirements could be filled through the following approaches: (i) relabeling with simple terms that are immediately understandable; (ii) adopting guidelines for making sense of the whole X-artifact family; and (iii) sidestepping the IT artifact and focusing directly on IT-enabled work systems in organizations.},

  Abstract                 = {This article aims at identifying the factors influencing the implementation of Web accessibility (WA) by European banks and its effects on the visibility through the Internet. We studied a database made up of 51 European banks whose shares are included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX® TMI Banks [8300] Index. Regarding the factors for the implementation of WA, we considered two feasible reasons. First, WA adoption can be motivated by operational factors, as WA can contribute to increase the efficiency of the operations. Second, WA can also be understood as a part of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy, so banks that are more committed with CSR should be more prone to implement WA. However, our results indicate that neither operational nor social factors seem to have exerted a significant influence on WA adoption. An implication of these findings is the advisability of orientating governmental policies to firm awareness of the fact that WA should be a part of the CSR activities of banks. Regarding the effects of the implementation of WA, our results indicate that the effort pays dividends in terms of Internet visibility. This could eventually contribute to increase future revenues and, therefore, the performance of WA-committed banks.},

  Abstract                 = {Sustainability is not a passing fad, although the finance function as a whole often remains skeptical of sustainability efforts and reporting. This article argues that Finance should become an involved participant—and even a leader—in sustainability efforts. It shows how the finance function can add value to these efforts and why this help is crucial. It then introduces a maturity model against which the finance function can assess its status in supporting and leading sustainability initiatives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The findings illustrate that the complexity of data consumption patterns drove increased interdependence within the financial information supply chain requiring the co-operative development of context sensitive data exchanges and commodity-like IT infrastructures. The paper concludes that the co-operative model to IOS development exhibited here is likely to be more suited to the development of systems for financial information supply chains than the hub and spoke model characteristic of IOS in other sectors.

This new score of operational risk is merged with a financial risk score in order to obtain an integrated measure of risk. The proposed integration methodology is a generalization of the merging model suggested in Fagini and Giudici (J. Oper. Res. Soc. 2010; in press) for a hierarchical data structure. In order to demonstrate the methodology, we use real data from a telecommunication company providing services to enterprises in different business lines and geographical locations. For each enterprise, we have collected information about operational and financial performance. The approach demonstrated in this case study can be generalized to general service providers who are concerned by both the quality of service and the financial solvency of their customers.

The quality of SETU standard is ok compared to other electronic standards such as the US-GAAP XBRL standard in financial reporting. The study provides results to the SETU standards organization, in two ways: 1. the low quality of implementations raises the question what the SETU organization can do to improve the implementations; education, mandatory validation, or even certification might be solutions; 2. the analysis has been used for an improvement project within SETU. The analysis of element usage frequency and the two groups of frequent errors might lead to changes in new version of the standard.},

By using semi-structured interviews and a postal questionnaire survey, the perceptions of financial auditors and information technology (IT) audit practitioners were sought. The findings identify factors affecting, and pressures leading to, audit change in response to e-business as perceived by these auditors. Overall, the most obvious aspect of e-business audit change was felt to be the extensive use of IT-driven practices and techniques, and this change could not only be attributed to technical factors, but they also thought that competitive and professional factors were also important drivers of audit change.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on some of the ethical issues related to voluntary disclosure of qualitative information by Canadian public companies. Drawing on various organizational theories, we examine some of the ways that companies can symbolically manage legitimacy through disclosure. Press releases of a sample of companies that received cease-trading orders were analysed for their use of language. We found that high-risk companies attempted to manage legitimacy by selectively releasing information and by using ambiguous language. Moreover, some companies behaved unethically by using language that suggested a positive future despite the imminent release of a cease-trading order. These findings have implications for organizational and accounting theorists and stakeholders in the corporate, fiduciary, and investment communities. Copyright © 2008 ASAC.

Interactive data were perceived by participants as quick and ‘accurate’, but it failed to facilitate the identification of the adjustment needed to make the ratios accurate for comparison. An important implication is that regulators and software designers should work to reduce user reliance on the comparability of ratios generated automatically using interactive data.},

As adoption of innovations and CSR commitment are linked with firm size and national culture/legislation, we hypothesize that size and national culture/legislation, may have an effect on WA level. The authors studied an international sample made up of companies included in EUROSTOXX600 (The STOXX Europe 600 Index). The main results suggest that both size and culture have a significant effect on WA. Large firms as well as Anglo-Saxon companies are more prone to have higher WA levels. A deeper analysis, which was done through the estimation of quantile regression equations, showed that the influence of size is significant for companies trying to excel or for those trying to avoid the worst WA. However, the effect of size is significant only in the lowest part of the conditional distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a language for the electronic communication of business and financial data which is revolutionizing business reporting around the world. It is a tool to bridge potential language barriers and unify financial reporting. This has appeal to foreign investors, among others, who can rely on information in XBRL-tagged financial reports to make investment decisions without having to translate financial statements from local language. In 2008, Israel required most public companies to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for financial reporting and to use XBRL-tagged reporting format, as part of an aggressive effort to make its capital markets more transparent and attractive for foreign investors. In this paper, we study all Israeli public companies and analyze the accuracy and reliability of their XBRL-tagged financial statements that are available on MAGNA, the Israel Securities Authority's electronic system. We describe the process by which the XBRL-based data were collected and reported. We document, categorize, and analyze deficiencies in the XBRL-tagged filings, and inconsistencies between them and the Hebrew-based annual reports. We observe pervasive data entry errors resulting in inaccurate XBRL-generated financial reports, which went undetected for over one year. Further, first year XBRL reporting (in conjunction with IFRS adoption) did not increase foreign investment in the Israeli capital markets. This analysis allows us to better understand the benefits and challenges of the adoption of XBRL.},

None of the variation in score is explained by corporate revenue in the Asian and European firms in this sample (revenues greater than about $9 billion), but there is a very weak correlation between score and revenue for American firms of this size, and a stronger one when Fortune 1000 companies (all American) with revenues smaller than this are included, suggesting that, as corporate size reaches a certain threshold, sustainability reporting becomes independent of it.

To provide confidentiality against the intermediaries along the message path, XML encryption is used to partially encrypt the message. Because the data structure is changed by the partial encryption, the encrypted message is no longer valid with respect to the original schema definition. Thus, problems occur regarding the processing of the schema validation and the data binding by the intermediary. In this paper, we discuss two possible methods to solve these problems. The first method is to transform the original schema definition. The second is to transform the received message.

In addition, using the financial report in the database, students prepare and validate an eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) document for CIS. Instead of applying the complex U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Taxonomies, Release 2009, the case uses a dedicated CIS Taxonomy to complete the mapping and tagging processes.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine whether XBRL adoption by publicly traded firms on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange is related to the level of total accruals that firms report in the pre-XBRL versus post-XBRL periods. Our results indicate that the level of total accruals in the post-XBRL period is lower relative to the pre-XBRL period. This finding is robust to several controls for macroeconomic conditions and firm fundamentals. Moreover, we find this main effect is most prominent for firms that are most likely to benefit from greater transparency: high-growth firms, small firms, and firms in high-technology industries. One interpretation of our results is that XBRL implementation decreases investor’s information acquisition costs and thereby improves their ability to detect earnings management; managers in turn reduce accruals.},

  Abstract                 = {Systems engineers have always been concerned with the problems surrounding complex systems. An evolutionary class of complex systems called Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) is even more relevant today as we struggle to understand and cope with the often undesirable emergence effects of some of these systems, evidenced by recurring financial and sociopolitical crises. A key characteristic of CAS is a large, diverse, and sometimes unknown set of interactions both internally and across the system boundary. For the purpose of managing this complexity we present in this paper the concept that a principles orientation as compared to rules orientation of a complex system is an important and useful characteristic in need of further study. The US financial system is used as a CAS exemplar in support of this inquiry. ©2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 15},

  Abstract                 = {Availability of business data is an important aspect of effective financial activities. An easy access to financial information has immense influence on actions and decisions regarding investing, trade and operations of companies and firms. The proposed standard – eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) – provides a means to create a uniform framework for representing corporate and financial information. XBRL defines an easily interpretable, machine-readable and XML-based data format. Its flexibility allows for representing business data using different languages, as well as following different regulation standards.One of important benefits of XBRL is application of XML-based tools and systems that enable easy preparation, processing and validation of corporate data. It is also possible to use XML-based storage and query systems.In this paper we propose and describe a concept of soft queries. They provide the users with a human-friendly interface for interacting with XBRL data. These queries are equipped with linguistic terms (such as large, medium, small) and linguistic qualifiers (all, mostly). Such queries are able to provide the users with results similar to the results obtained when they analyse data themselves. Linguistic terms and qualifiers are represented as fuzzy sets. Fuzzy-based operations and aggregation operators allow for mimicking a human-like processing of data. The proposed approach is illustrated with queries executed on an XBRL document.

  Abstract                 = {The benefits of using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) as a business reporting standard have been widely canvassed in the extant literature, in particular, as the enabling technology for standard business reporting tools. One of the key benefits noted is the ability of standard business reporting to create significant efficiencies in the regulatory reporting process. Efficiency-driven cost reductions are highly desirable by data and report producers. However, they may not have the same potential to create long-term firm value as improved effectiveness of decision making. This study assesses the perceptions of Australian business stakeholders in relation to the benefits of the Australian standard business reporting instantiation (SBR) for financial reporting. These perceptions were drawn from interviews of persons knowledgeable in XBRL-based standard business reporting and submissions to Treasury relative to SBR reporting options. The combination of interviews and submissions permit insights into the views of various groups of stakeholders in relation to the potential benefits. In line with predictions based on a transaction-cost economics perspective, interviewees who primarily came from a data and report-producer background mentioned benefits that centre largely on asset specificity and efficiency. The interviewees who principally came from a data and report-consumer background mentioned benefits that centre on reducing decision-making uncertainty and decision-making effectiveness. The data and report consumers also took a broader view of the benefits of SBR to the financial reporting supply chain. Our research suggests that advocates of SBR have successfully promoted its efficiency benefits to potential users. However, the effectiveness benefits of SBR, for example, the decision-making benefits offered to investors via standardised reports, while becoming more broadly acknowledged, remain not a priority for all stakeholders.},

This paper presents a project focussed on designing a general-purpose query language in support of mining XML data. In our framework, raw data, mining models and domain knowledge are represented by way of XML documents and stored inside native XML databases. Data mining (DM) tasks are expressed in an extension of XQuery. Special attention is given to the frequent pattern discovery problem, and a way of exploiting domain-dependent optimizations and efficient data structures as deeper as possible in the extraction process is presented. We report the results of a first bunch of experiments, showing that a good trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency in XML DM is not a chimera. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The markets are developed by a GARCH model based on the S&P 500. These simulated markets are grouped by a main parameter: high volatility, bearish trend, bullish trend and low volatility. The inputs retained of the SVM are traditional technical trading rules used in quantitative analysis, such as relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) decision rules. The outputs of the SVM are the degree of set membership and market movement (bullish or bearish). The design of the SVM algorithm has been developed by Matlab and SVM-KM. The configuration for the SVM shows that the best results are achieved in simulated markets with high volatility; also results are good in trend simulated markets.

In this article, the Chief Innovation Officer of CDP discusses five ways that such disclosure is expected to lead to changes in corporate behavior.The first two are “internal” mechanisms that tend to encourage constructive change more or less directly as a result of going through the process of disclosure. One is known as “WGMGM,” which is shorthand for the often-cited principle that “what gets measured gets managed.” The second is the tendency of disclosure to bring about valuable changes in strategic thinking.The next two are mechanisms that work to effect change through “external” channels. One relies on the use of data to enable investors, regulators, and other corporate stakeholders to draw comparisons among companies and industries in assessing the value implications of climate change disclosure. The second involves competitor benchmarking and the growing use of data in investment research.Fifth and last, recent evidence suggests that a growing number of investors are willing to raise the bar in terms of the expectations they place on companies to act responsibly now in the face of current and expected future changes.Each of these five change processes are discussed while citing evidence drawn from CDP's long experience of managing the disclosure process and working with both investors and companies to convert data into action.},

  Abstract                 = {The systematic adoption of the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for financial reporting represents a great challenge. Worldwide, a large number of regulators are making an effort to promote the adoption of this standard to simplify and enhance the communication of financial information. This requires the definition of well-structured taxonomies that can standardize and accommodate the content of financial reports prepared by firms. This study aims to analyze the regulator-led adoption of XBRL for financial reporting. It examines the XBRL taxonomies used by Italian firms to reflect their financial reporting under rule-based Italian GAAP and principles-based International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). We compare the alignment of the Italian GAAP taxonomy and the IFRS taxonomy with Italian companies' financial statements and find two different levels of fit. The results offer useful insights for regulators and policy makers in prescribing or establishing appropriate taxonomies. We illustrate the potential impacts of the different taxonomies on the quality of financial reporting in terms of comparability and potential loss of information.},

  Abstract                 = {Reliable public sector information serves as a pivotal source for big data. Government postal codes, for instance, have been crucial for predicting demographics. Confidentiality, however, may be at risk when combined with other sources. Public sector information not only describes government activity but contains material, such as campaign finance filings, produced by outside sources. How does information production impact policy concerns if material is reused for big data projects? Information production is analyzed using a framework of five methods of production. The framework considers information that the public sector writes, publishes, manages, produces through research, and compiles through legal mandates. This paper examines the policy implications of using U.S. federal public sector information in big data projects.},

It would be dangerous, however, to consider accounting issues in isolation, as the choices made can have significant wider impacts. This chapter examines those wider impacts, starting with impacts closely aligned to the accounting issues, namely impacts to do with systems, controls and internal audit. It considers the role of internal audit and of the audit committee. Both have important roles to play in helping to ensure that IFRS reporting becomes embedded in the organisation, and that assurance is obtained over the integrity of the IFRS reporting systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Business reports are changing in response to regulatory and market demands. Requests by regulators for electronic filings of financial statements and tax forms are increasing and such filings are rapidly becoming mandatory in many countries. In response, extensible business reporting language (XBRL) is a market-driven, collaborative effort to make electronic filings more useful to, and to reduce the burden on, both publishers and consumers of business reports. XBRL does much more than simply list data items that can be submitted in an electronic filing. XBRL is a complete set of tools for regulators or groups to fully communicate the meanings of and interrelationships among the business reporting concepts. In addition, core sets of concepts from regulators or groups can be extended, expanded, or otherwise modified for more specific communication by jurisdictions, industries, or individual corporations. This unique customization capability lets companies better present their electronic filings as parallels to their paper filings. A "customizable standard" offers new opportunities and new challenges. This paper discusses XBRL's paradoxical power - the trade-offs between customizing to better parallel existing paper reports and compromising to more closely match the standards, and the research needed for the transition from freeform to customized reports.},

  Abstract                 = {With the January 2009 mandate by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of Interactive Data, as well as other governmental mandates and opportunities for compliance burden reductions globally, the Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is becoming a more common and necessary part of corporate governance and compliance. Due to this external pressure, as well as the primary focus of XBRL advocates themselves to encourage governmental adoption of XBRL for compliance reporting, another important deliverable from XBRL International, Inc.- XBRL's Global Ledger Framework (XBRL GL)- and its obvious and immediate benefits to organisations has been given much less visibility than the external focused efforts; however, XBRL GL has the potential to bring more measurable benefit to companies, in addition to helping support the benefits regulators and the markets receive from more transparent external reporting. XBRL GL serves as a metadata hub (to facilitate system interoperability), as a common face to data from different systems (facilitating common toolsets and controls) and as a tool to enable a seamless audit trail, spanning gaps between systems. XBRL GL seamlessly integrates incoming transactions and external facing reports, acting as a bridge, a single, holistic, generic view of data. While companies can continue to choose proprietary approaches, and while the XBRL Specification itself is sometimes used as the basis for those approaches, it is a proper combination of XBRL GL with XBRL for external reporting that may offer the greatest benefit to companies. While XBRL GL has some obvious potential benefits, the risk to companies and to the market as a whole is that lack of adoption of XBRL GL will lead to a proliferation of proprietary standards at different points in the Business Reporting Supply Chain and for different consumers, such as the world's tax regulators, leading to more confusion and burden instead of providing holistic solutions that provide benefits for all. Those responsible for corporate governance have a responsibility to make sure that interoperability solutions are being chosen with an eye on long-term value, and not just the easiest solution in the short term. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.},

  Abstract                 = {The XML Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a standard for business and financial information reporting. It is based on XML so instance documents based on XBRL, e.g. a quarterly report, are highly constrained by the XML document-oriented nature. This makes more difficult to perform queries that mix information from filings from different dates, companies, or accounting principles than with a formalism based on a graph model instead of a tree model. Semantic Web technologies provide a graph model that facilitates mashing-up different XBRL sources. We have put into practice this approach mapping the XBRL filings available from the SEC's EDGAR program to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the XML Schema taxonomies these filings are based on to Web Ontology Language (OWL). The resulting semantic metadata, though highly tied to the XML structure it is mapped from, benefits from Semantic Web technologies and tools in order to facilitate integration and cross-querying, even together with other parts of the Web of Linked Data.},

  Abstract                 = {Irregular activities such as fraud often lead to recurring, identifiable patterns in the meta-information. Such patterns may be automatically identified by means of a grammatical rule set which uses compiler construction techniques to identify the origin of the irregularity and the pattern associated with it. The eXtensible Modelling Language (XML) is often used to facilitate inter-operation of applications. Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is based on the concept of XML and is an open, human readable format designed for the sharing of financial information. Due the ease of editing and modifying human readable information, it is comparatively easy to manipulate the information contained in XBRL in a fraudulent way. An example might be to edit the totals of a transaction or to add a bogus transaction to the data. Our research addresses this problem by applying compiler construction techniques on the XBRL information. In doing so, we hope to extract useful forensic information from the patterns in the meta-information which may in turn be used for prosecution in case of irregularities (such as fraud). Our techniques can be further applied to other XML based applications (such as command and control XML specifications) to detect irregularities in a post-event analysis. The paper reports on a prototype that was constructed using standard compiler construction tools such as Lex and Yacc under Linux. We have used these tools to construct a grammar and to compile the grammar into an executable. The executable was then run on a set of XBRL inputs, where it performed pattern matching on the meta-information in the XBRL input. The parser was generated to parse correct XBRL; the 'normal' productions that form part of correct XBRL were augmented by error productions to deal with a few examples of fraudulent actions. The prototype was able to identify pre-defined fraud patterns in the XBRL-file. It is thus possible to conclude that grammar rules and compiler construction can be used to successfully parse meta-information and extract forensic information.},

Moreover, tools such as XBRL have been developed to deal with the automatic generation of business reports. However the available tools are not suitable to sup-port the current tendency towards the so called, Continuous Reporting. Here, for a specific purpose, the wealth of available information should be summarized in short reports where the relevant information is remarked while the irrelevant remains hidden. Using a combination of Zadeh's Computational Theory of Perceptions and Semantic Web techniques, we propose a first approach to a computational framework to generate short reports that consist of few but meaningful Natural Language sentences. These sentences are designed to solve the user needs in a specific context of meaning defined with the help of an ontology. A practical demonstration of the computational framework is included.©2010 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Businesses continually invest in new information technologies (IT) for improved reporting. EXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is an example of IT that allows financial statements to be transmitted and analysed electronically. The international business community has shown strong support for XBRL, with several countries mandating financial reporting using XBRL. However, even though organisations may be required to transmit XBRL-formatted financial statements, users of such statements would still need to choose whether or not they wish to analyse them with XBRL-enabled analysis tools. Earlier research indicates that the individual user's perceptions of IT tools are frequently negatively biased and that IT tools are commonly underused as a result. If this general finding were to be true for XBRL use, it could seriously affect XBRL's diffusion into the business community. The authors, both CPAs and accounting professors, investigate the relationship between XBRL use and perception by surveying 61 MBA students as proxies for nonprofessional investors. Results indicate that although perceptions of XBRL are generally positive, increased use of XBRL leads to more positive perceptions. Thus, organisations promoting the spread of XBRL should consider making access to XBRL analysis tools as easy and widely available as possible. Additionally, organisations that issue XBRL-formatted reports are perceived more positively than ones that do not issue such reports (a halo effect). © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.},

Both the American Institute of Certified of Public Accountants and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Task Force on Assurance Services have identified continuous auditing as a service that should be offered. Continuous auditing is significantly different from an annual financial statement audit. A latest research report produced by the CICA defines a continuous audit as: "a methodology that enables independent auditors to provide written assurance on a subject matter using a series of auditors' reports issued simultaneously with, or a short period of time after, the occurrence of events underlying the subject matter." However, continuous auditing would present significant technical hurdles. These technical hurdles could be overcome if certain conditions exist. Computer-assisted audit tools (CAATs) are one of the conditions that must exist in order to conduct the continuous auditing. CAATs are defined as computer-assisted tools that permit auditors to increase their productivity, as well as that of the audit function. Therefore, with the real-time accounting and electronic data interchange popularizing, CAATs are becoming even more necessary. The demand for timely and forward-looking information hints that the continuous audit will eventually replace the traditional audit report on year-end results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

  Abstract                 = {The Basel Capital Agreement (Basel II) required all banking entities actively to manage Operational Risk by means of making explicit measurements and creating specific items in their general ledgers. Currently, the most sophisticated resource for handling transactional information is the XBRL-GL Taxonomy, an electronic dictionary of business elements or digital tags based on eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), the digital mark-up language for financial contexts, which in turn has the special feature of incorporating transactional or Global Ledger (GL) information. This study proposes, in one hand, an extension of that dictionary, to incorporate Operational Risk information, and in the other hand, a simple tool to edit and visualise such reports, called BaselMapper, which is tested with a business expert. Since this experimental tool, BaselMapper, was created in 2007 and validated in 2008, till the publication date of this article, several changes have occurred in both its normative and technical foundations. Due to the financial crisis, the Bank of International Settlements has developed a new set of reforms in banking regulation, beyond the Basel II agreement described here, called Basel III. To consult the current regulatory framework, please visit: http://www.bis.org/bcbs/ basel3.htm Operational Risk aspects were not modified. Additionally, a new version of the XBRLGL taxonomy is now available, called Global Ledger, at: http://www.xbrl.org/GLFiles/that still incorporates the COR-BUS module used here. So, essentially, these changes do not modify the aim of this paper, which is to promote the use of XBRL-enabled technology for Operational Risk measurement in banking institutions at the international level. Further research will be necessary to maintain this tool properly updated, with the substantial participation of more potential users. Copyright &copy; 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The XML Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a standard for business and financial information reporting. It is based on XML so instance documents based on XBRL, e.g. a quarterly report, are highly constrained by the XML document-oriented nature. This makes more difficult to perform queries that mix information from filings from different dates, companies, or accounting principles than with a formalism based on a graph model instead of a tree model. Semantic Web technologies provide a graph model that facilitates mashing-up different XBRL sources. We have put into practice this approach mapping the XBRL filings available from the SEC's EDGAR program to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the XML Schema taxonomies these filings are based on to Web Ontology Language (OWL). The resulting semantic metadata, though highly tied to the XML structure it is mapped from, benefits from Semantic Web technologies and tools in order to facilitate integration and cross-querying, even together with other parts of the Web of Linked Data.},

Footnotes, which include important explanations about financial values, have still an unstructured format and are an obstacle for analysts and other stakeholders who want to benefit from analyzing financial statements. It is of interest how data integration approaches can support and facilitate the process of data extraction from footnotes automatically to gain accurate and reasonable analysis to avoid manual tasks. To address this issue, a state of the art is needed to identify and cluster relevant existing methods in terms of structured and unstructured data integration. It is shown that most of the existing literature is focused on a storage level of data integration. Other researchers deal with methods and tools to integrate and analyze structured and unstructured data separately. But, no identified paper illustrates an unstructured data integration solution to support analytical tasks based on XBRL documents. &copy; (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Irregular activities such as fraud often lead to recurring, identifiable patterns in the meta-information. Such patterns may be automatically identified by means of a grammatical rule set which uses compiler construction techniques to identify the origin of the irregularity and the pattern associated with it. The eXtensible Modelling Language (XML) is often used to facilitate inter-operation of applications. Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is based on the concept of XML and is an open, human readable format designed for the sharing of financial information. Due the ease of editing and modifying human readable information, it is comparatively easy to manipulate the information contained in XBRL in a fraudulent way. An example might be to edit the totals of a transaction or to add a bogus transaction to the data. Our research addresses this problem by applying compiler construction techniques on the XBRL information. In doing so, we hope to extract useful forensic information from the patterns in the meta-information which may in turn be used for prosecution in case of irregularities (such as fraud). Our techniques can be further applied to other XML based applications (such as command and control XML specifications) to detect irregularities in a post-event analysis. The paper reports on a prototype that was constructed using standard compiler construction tools such as Lex and Yacc under Linux. We have used these tools to construct a grammar and to compile the grammar into an executable. The executable was then run on a set of XBRL inputs, where it performed pattern matching on the meta-information in the XBRL input. The parser was generated to parse correct XBRL; the 'normal' productions that form part of correct XBRL were augmented by error productions to deal with a few examples of fraudulent actions. The prototype was able to identify pre-defined fraud patterns in the XBRL-file. It is thus possible to conclude that grammar rules and compiler construction can be used to successfully parse meta-information and extract forensic information.},

It is no problem to add more: CASI, CSAQ, EDI, XML, XBRL - all of them and many more will appear in this article (and in the glossary). It is not always easy for statisticians and ICT specialists to understand each other. However, ICT is needed to automate statistical data reporting in order to save resources and improve processes - so both communities are condemned to co-operate. In this scenario, a third area with yet another jargon is playing an important role, namely e-business: more and more, statistical EDR is using e-business tools and methods, like for example EDIFACT or ebXML. This paper tries to shed some light on the ICT and e-business aspects of statistical data reporting. The questions addressed in this paper include: What is EDR? What is metadata for EDR? Which metadata standards for EDR are available or coming up? And how is the ESS concerned or involved? The current situation of EDI standardisation is examined in more detail: the transition from EDIFACT to XML and the adoption of ebXML for the ESS.},

However the available tools are not suitable to sup-port the current tendency towards the so called, Continuous Reporting. Here, for a specific purpose, the wealth of available information should be summarized in short reports where the relevant information is remarked while the irrelevant remains hidden. Using a combination of Zadeh's Computational Theory of Perceptions and Semantic Web techniques, we propose a first approach to a computational framework to generate short reports that consist of few but meaningful Natural Language sentences. These sentences are designed to solve the user needs in a specific context of meaning defined with the help of an ontology. A practical demonstration of the computational framework is included.&copy;2010 IEEE.},
