  Abstract                 = {In a traditional search engine interaction scenario, a user begins with a certain concept and finds documents that are similar to their concept. However, the user may wish to compare alternatives and a search capability should compare concepts and present the best alternatives. This task can be difficult without proper decision aids. We propose a concept comparison engine as a decision support tool that may be used to compare attributes of different alternatives and aid in making an informed selection. We describe an architecture and an interaction scenario and implement a prototype. We propose a number of evaluation metrics for measuring the viability of different terms for the purpose of comparing concepts. In scripted experiments, orderings for candidate terms from the prototype are compared to gold standard ranking lists from structured external sources. Our results indicate that a Rankor analysis may be promising as a measure of the differentiating power of candidate terms a user might choose to support concept comparison. },

We analyzed four data sets from a family of experiments conducted in Spain, Argentina and Austria. Results showed that \{OOmFPWeb\} is efficient when compared to current industry practices. \{OOmFPWeb\} produced reproducible functional size measurements and was perceived as easy to use and useful by the study participants, who also expressed their intention to use \{OOmFPWeb\} in the future. The analysis further supports the validity and reliability of the technology acceptance model (TAM)-based evaluation instrument used in the study. },

We find that while there is strong support for the idea of one set of high quality global accounting standards, a majority of respondents are opposed to the proposed roadmap. Additionally, our results suggest that comments received systematically differ with respondent characteristics such as respondent type, firm characteristics, and industry affiliation. Finally, the complementary use of \{CLUTO\} with manual content analysis and the robust results obtained from CLUTO, provide support for the potential use of \{CLUTO\} to examine large textual databases in future accounting research. },

Account Rev 2007;82(5): 1365–1374] which questioned the direction and value added of non-AIS accounting research, we discuss the state of research in Accounting Information Systems. \{AIS\} researchers face a significant hurdle in undertaking value added research given that the financial and human resources that industry devotes to research and development of \{AIS\} technology dwarf the capabilities of academic researchers. In these circumstances, we put forward a paradigm for \{AIS\} research based on the principle of comparative advantage, which is the powerful economic force that ensures that trade can take place even between parties where one has an absolute superiority over the other. It is our contention that if \{AIS\} academics are to succeed in creating value added research then they have to identify what they can do that the \{AIS\} industry, despite all its financial and human resource advantages, cannot or will not do. And what economic theory indicates is that such opportunities to add value always exist — if only academics are willing to seek them out. We illustrate our paradigm by analyzing three potential sources of comparative advantage for \{AIS\} researchers and discussing illustrative examples of research in each of these areas. },

Ultimately data, however it is formatted, is simply a means towards an end and it provides no value added unless different decisions are made as a result of its availability. We use Elliott's (1998) model of decision making and apply it to the governance area to serve as a framework for an investigation of precisely how \{XBRL\} will provide value added. We then analyze the current specifications of XBRL, both its taxonomies and the way in which tagged data is rendered, to answer the question of whether XBRL—as opposed to the generic concept of tagged data—takes full advantage of its potential to improve governance decision making. },

  Abstract                 = {A growing body of literature spanning the social, psychological, and neurological sciences is studying the influence of affect (emotions, feelings and moods) within a variety of decision-making contexts. Accounting Information Systems (AIS) researchers interested in capturing affect within such contexts ought to consider methods that are designed to capture affect close to its realization. One such approach is the experience sampling method (ESM), developed as a way to collect individuals' subjective perceptions of their cognitions, motivations and affect as they become manifest. In short, \{ESM\} involves capturing brief responses from individuals throughout the day over the course of weeks or even months. By doing so, researchers can strengthen internal validity weaknesses associated with surveys and interviews, and increase ecological validity beyond laboratory experiments. \{ESM\} data is rich with possibilities for within- and between-participant comparisons. However, conducting an \{ESM\} study is much more intense and time-consuming than a one-time survey. In this paper, we discuss the concept of ESM, explain how and it can be used for studying affect, explore various theoretical considerations, and mention some key implementation issues. Our objective is to highlight the \{ESM\} and offer directions for \{AIS\} researchers interested in evaluating the suitability of the \{ESM\} method for their research programs. },

  Abstract                 = {Transforming Business-to-Government (B2G) information exchange is a next frontier for reducing government spending while improving performance. This paper examines two different \{B2G\} information exchange architectures that reflect continuing transformations that empower some government agencies to do better compliance monitoring tasks with fewer resources. The win for the reporting companies is the lower cost of compliance. Instead of focusing on collecting compliance information from individual companies, the government agencies in this study focus on collecting information on the supply chain level, allowing for automated data reconciliation. Our findings reveal that pushing controls (automated checks) upstream (in company software and data sources) results in more efficiency, higher information quality and reduces redundant controls. The examined architectures exhibit high levels of compliance by design, meaning that many control objectives are by default encompassed in the design. This requires a well-aligned combination of data standardization (using shared syntax and semantics) and automated information processing (using an intelligent gateway between businesses and government agencies). However, achieving such an alignment is a difficult challenge; especially when taking into account that such transformations require solid governance, trust and high initial investments — prerequisites that are rare in many public-private partnerships. },

A content analysis was conducted on the annual sustainability reports on the websites of 306 Eurozone companies listed in the \{STOXX\} Europe 600. The results revealed an intensive use of corporate governance indicators, a moderate disclosure of environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), and a low use of social indicators. Our study also showed that there is an influence of sector, and the listing in \{DJSI\} on the extent of sustainability reporting. },

The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of media and content types on stakeholders' engagement on Western European local governments' Facebook pages. The sample includes 15-member countries of the \{EU\} via 75 local governments belonging to four different public administration styles, analyzing 50 posts from each municipality. The posts were coded into 16 content types (e.g. environment, housing) and 5 media types (e.g. video, text), respectively. Metrics of popularity, commitment, virality and engagement were also computed for each post. Results show that the most used media types are links and photos. Cultural activities, sports and marketing related topics are the most widely posted by Western European local governments, but these contents do not seem to be the most relevant for citizens. Local governments' preferences to different media and content types seem to depend on the institutional context. Significant differences on engagement levels by citizens have also been found among media and content types and in different institutional contexts. This study provides practitioners and academics with some initial research findings about the effect of different communicational strategies on citizen engagement, which are very important factors in order to improve the effectiveness of e-participation offerings. },

The search for new styles of governance which promote higher levels of transparency and the engagement of citizens is viewed as a way of improving citizens' trust in governments. As the social media are becoming ubiquitous, both academics and practitioners need some initial and reliable background data about the deployment of this kind of technology at all levels. The aim of this work is to provide an overall view about the use of Web 2.0 and social media tools in \{EU\} local governments in order to determine whether local governments are using these technologies to increase transparency and e-participation, opening a real corporate dialog. In addition, the paper tries to identify which factors promote the level of development of these tools at local level. Our results show that most local governments are using Web 2.0 and social media tools to enhance transparency but, in general, the concept of corporate dialog and the use of Web 2.0 to promote e-participation are still in their infancy at the local level. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper examines how the U.S. accounting profession, through the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), sought to restore its damaged reputation and re-legitimize its claim to self-regulation after the Enron scandal. We do so by analyzing the content of \{AICPA\} leaders’ web communications to members and outsiders of the Institute between 1997 and 2010 and draw upon the concepts of logics and discourse. We argue that the marketing language surrounding the AICPA's “Vision Project” prior to Enron (1997–2001) is not durably supplanted by the language of parrhesia, celebrated during the Enron crisis management episode (2002–2004) – it reemerges after 2005, juxtaposed to parrhesia. This study contributes to increasing our understanding of the institutional complexity of the accounting professional field by suggesting that this complexity is, in part, cultivated and reproduced by \{AICPA\} leaders’ navigation between different conceptions of being an accountant. Institutional complexity can thus be viewed as a resource, rather than a constraint, which provides flexible impression management opportunities. },

Two typical examples from textbooks are the irrelevance of sunk costs and, more recently, the affect of knowing the outcome of a decision or revised budget forecast. Individual differences in the cognitive ability of decision makers to use information can lead to systematic differences in judgments. We identify and label one of these individual cognitive differences comprehensive thinking ability: the ability to think about multiple paths, branches or alternatives. Significant comprehensive thinking ability is likely to mitigate systematic differences in judgment in many contexts. We report the results of a series of studies using a variation on the investment trap (sunk cost or irrelevant cost) problem and a probability revision task. The findings suggest that comprehensive thinking ability may also explain other common systematic differences in judgment. },

They are used by relatively small groups of users consisting of information analysts and power users, for whom data and analysis are their primary jobs. We present an ontology-based approach for \{BI\} applications, specifically in statistical analysis and data mining. We implemented our approach in financial knowledge management system (FKMS), which is able to do: (i) data extraction, transformation and loading, (ii) data cubes creation and retrieval, (iii) statistical analysis and data mining, (iv) experiment metadata management, (v) experiment retrieval for new problem solving. The resulting knowledge from each experiment defined as a knowledge set consisting of strings of data, model, parameters, and reports are stored, shared, disseminated, and thus helpful to support decision making. We finally illustrate the above claims with a process of applying data mining techniques to support corporate bonds classification. },

We argue that corporations use Internet reporting and website platforms to project a more socially acceptable environmental management approach to public stakeholders. We argue further that this disclosure activity is often de-coupled from their actual environmental performance. To test these conjectures, we refine and employ a comprehensive disclosure evaluation metric to assess both the content and the presentation of these types of disclosures and utilize a firm's America's Toxic 100 toxic score, a newly developed measure based on the \{US\} Environmental Protection Agency's toxics release inventory (TRI) data, to proxy for environmental performance. Based on empirical tests of four size-matched samples, our findings support our conjectures, showing that worse environmental performers provide more extensive disclosure in terms of content and website presentation. },

  Abstract                 = {The online services of \{B2B\} e-commerce have had to face a challenge resulting from the diverse services built on heterogeneous platforms that must work together in an integrated and seamless manner. Today, businesses have accumulated large numbers of online services that run and reside on a variety of environments. Furthermore, they have different workflows and operational support systems that need to interact with their legacy systems. The result has been chaotic and disruptive. We developed a new framework, artifact, and performance model with which to address this problem. A multi-agent e-service system was developed to cope with dynamics and upheaval. We used a customer-centric viewpoint with supply chains both upstream and downstream. An implementation was performed to determine problems in its development. Two simple live case studies were conducted to illustrate the model's feasibility and validity. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A core application of \{XBRL\} is to facilitate the flow of tagged financial statements and annual reports, from companies and other entities directly to the databases, web sites, and computers of regulators, stakeholders and other information consumers. Increasingly, \{XBRL\} provides the technological foundation for the communication of financial information where there is independent assurance. This XBRL-based assurance may be on the financial statements (i.e., an electronically consumable form of today's standard \{PDF\} or \{HTML\} audit report) or focus on the quality of the \{XBRL\} exhibit (i.e., the instance document). Regardless of the type of \{XBRL\} assurance report, maintenance of the security and integrity of the instance document is paramount. This conceptual paper identifies and discusses the communication, security challenges and relevant research issues when there is independent assurance on financial statements formatted in XBRL. Successful electronic communication of assurance to information consumers should clearly distinguish the responsibilities of management (i.e., the financial statements) and the auditor (i.e., the audit report). It is important to have an integrated approach where the assurance report, financial statements and other reports in which facts in the financial statements are incorporated are inextricably tied at the level of automated data consumption. Further, as much as possible, human interaction should be accommodated. The paper sets out a range of alternatives for maintenance of security on the assurance report. },

It discusses their implications for enterprise information management (EIM). It is not a comprehensive discussion of \{EIM\} requirements and methodology but rather a discussion of \{EIM\} from a business perspective and a focus on the aspects of \{EIM\} that require particular attention in a service-oriented, agile enterprise. Information is the lifeblood of the enterprise. Without information there can be no coordinated activity, no record of accomplishments, no plans for the future. Management of information is a critical responsibility and becomes increasingly critical as enterprises become international and require greater agility. \{EIM\} involves the validation, transformation, storage, communication, and presentation of data to provide information to support the pursuit of enterprise objectives. Data are the raw materials typically managed by computers; information is the organized presentation of data in context that has business meaning to humans. },

It presents a technique for optimal linear \{SVM\} classifier selection based on particle swarm optimization technique, providing significant amount of focus on imbalanced learning issue. It is compared to other classifiers in terms of accuracy and identification of each class. Experimental classification performance results, obtained using real world financial dataset from \{SEC\} \{EDGAR\} database, lead to conclusion that proposed technique is capable to produce results, comparable to other classifiers, such as logistic regression and \{RBF\} network, and thus be can be an appealing option for future development of real credit risk evaluation models. },

The quality of the \{XBRL\} data in the repository is vital for the success of the Commission’s interactive data program. A key aspect of the data quality of these filings is the correctness of the mathematical relationships implied by the taxonomy and implemented in the instance document. One quarter of the filings by the initial 400 large corporations in the first round of submissions had errors, with differences reported monetary facts and the sum of other monetary facts that were bound together in a computation relationship. The primary cause of these errors was inappropriate treatment in the instance documents of underlying debit/credit assumptions in the taxonomy. The results of the research have a number of implications for filers, the SEC, \{XBRL\} US, software vendors and the global \{XBRL\} community. },

  Abstract                 = {Fraud detection has become a critical component of financial audits and audit standards have heightened emphasis on journal entries as part of fraud detection. This paper canvasses perspectives on applying data mining techniques to journal entries. In the past, the impediment to researching journal entry data mining is getting access to journal entry data sets, which may explain why the published research in this area is a null set. For this project, we had access to journal entry data sets for 29 different organizations. Our initial exploratory test of the data sets had interesting preliminary findings. (1) For all 29 entities, the distribution of first digits of journal dollar amounts differed from that expected by Benford's Law. (2) Regarding last digits, unlike first digits, which are expected to have a logarithmic distribution, the last digits would be expected to have a uniform distribution. Our test found that the distribution was not uniform for many of the entities. In fact, eight entities had one number whose frequency was three times more than expected. (3) We compared the number of accounts related to the top five most frequently occurring three last digit combinations. Four entities had a very high occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved only a small set of accounts, one entity had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combination that involved a large set of accounts and 24 had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved a small set of accounts. In general, the first four entities would probably pose the highest risk of fraud because it could indicate that the fraudster is covering up or falsifying a particular class of transactions. In the future, we will apply more data mining techniques to discover other patterns and relationships in the data sets. We also want to seed the dataset with fraud indicators (e.g., pairs of accounts that would not be expected in a journal entry) and compare the sensitivity of the different data mining techniques to find these seeded indicators. },

Interactive data visualization tools that allow the investigator to change the representation of data from text to graphics and filter out subsets of transactions for further investigation have substantial potential for making the detection of fraudulent transactions more efficient and effective. However, little research to date has directly examined the efficacy of data visualization techniques for fraud detection. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to predict when and how investigators might use data visualization techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. We use this framework to develop testable propositions and research questions related to this topic. The paper concludes by discussing how academic research might proceed in investigating the efficacy of interactive data visualization tools for fraud detection. },

The Program, which has grown and evolved over the past 20 years, was founded on the purported benefits of experiential learning and calls dating back nearly three decades for curricular change designed to enhance the core competencies of accounting graduates. The internship is organized and run as an actual accounting practice in which the instructor serves as the Executive Partner and maintains professional liability insurance though the \{AICPA\} carrier. Students, working in teams ranging in size from three to seven, serve as the professional staff. The client base consists of not-for-profit organizations that vary in size and complexity. Services range from limited scope consulting engagements to operational and financial audits. As evidence of program quality, in 2011 the practice successfully completed an \{AICPA\} mandatory peer review for quality of accounting, auditing and attestation services performed by \{AICPA\} members in public practice. Additional assessment data in the form of student and employer feedback indicate that the Program is meeting its stated objectives. The description of program operations, cost and fee structure, and implementation recommendations presented in this paper may be used as a guide for those faculty interested in implementing similar programs at their institutions. },

This paper examines the impact of Internet-based disclosure on the French stock market by analyzing the relationship between information asymmetry and Internet disclosure practices. Extending previous studies on Web-based disclosure, a checklist of 40 items is developed to evaluate the level of Internet-based voluntary disclosure. Measuring information asymmetry by the spread and the probability of informed trading, we show that greater Web-based disclosure lowers information asymmetry in the French financial market. },

A similar format has been lacking for design science research. This issue was addressed by Peffers et al.

In this paper, we first discuss design science research and the DSRM. Then, we illustrate the application of the \{DSRM\} to \{AIS\} research through retroactive analysis. Finally, we integrate the \{DSRM\} into the operational specification of artifact networks and use the \{REA\} literature for illustration purposes. },

  Abstract                 = {This study examines whether, in the presentation of financial information, digital formats address the concern over users’ functional fixation. The accounting literature indicates that the presentation of financial information either within the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements often creates functional fixation where users of financial statements fail to adjust for differences in accounting policy. This leads users to judge what would otherwise be identical financial situations as being different due to the different accounting policies and methods adopted. It has been suggested that the use of digital formats in presenting financial reports may overcome functional fixation. Using an experimental design involving accountants in public practice, the results indicate that the use of digital formats to present financial reports does not fully overcome the issue of functional fixation in the processing of financial information. Although the participants were able to identify and extract relevant information, irrespective of whether or not the information was presented within the financial statements or in the notes to the accounts, the evidence indicates that functional fixation remained when the participants made final decisions based on available information. This suggests that functional fixation may not be caused by access to or extraction of information but by the level of perceived significance based on where the information is reported in the financial statements. In general, the results indicate that current technology may not be able to fully reduce functional fixation in the evaluation of financial information prepared in accordance with different accounting policies and methods. },

Private bankers need to have deep knowledge about an innumerable list of products and their characteristics as well as the suitability of each product for the client’s characteristics to be able to offer an optimal portfolio according to client expectations. Client and portfolio diversity calls for new recommendation and advice systems focused on their specific characteristics. This paper presents PB-ADVISOR, a system aimed at recommending investment portfolios based on fuzzy and semantic technologies to private bankers. The proposed system provides private bankers with a powerful tool to support their decision process and help deal with complex investment portfolios.

  Abstract                 = {The concept of continuous auditing originated over two decades ago. Yet despite its much touted benefits, its acceptance and use in practice has been slow. To gain insight into the state of affairs, we surveyed 210 internal auditors worldwide on the status of their use of continuous auditing. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) we explore the antecedents of internal auditors' intentions to use continuous auditing technology. Employing the Partial Least Squares method, we find strong support for the model with an \{R2\} of 44.3%. Specifically, we find that internal auditors' perceptions of effort expectancy and social influence are significant predictors of their intentions to use continuous auditing. We also find that annual sales volume of the company and voluntariness of use significantly moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and social influence respectively. Additionally, we find regional differences in the significance of key \{UTAUT\} antecedents. Specifically, we find that the North American internal auditors are more likely to use continuous auditing due to soft social coercion pressures of Social Influence through peers and higher authorities. On the other hand, Middle Eastern auditors are more likely to use the technology if it is mandated by the higher authorities. },

This work also illustrated strong growth in \{AICPA\} membership, and reported a shift in the activities of the \{AICPA\} members. Corporate practice was growing more quickly and public practice growing only very slowly, sometimes shrinking. The current paper examines 10 additional years of \{AICPA\} data and gathers further economic and demographic U.S. census data to explore these patterns and related issues. The professional membership of the \{AICPA\} continues to have relatively flat growth overall, and public practice has continued to decline relative to other pursuits of \{AICPA\} members. When the data are split into gender and age cohorts, different patterns are detected and challenges identified for continued involvement in the profession as defined by \{AICPA\} membership. },

Currently, the application of data mining to auditing is at an early stage of development and researchers take a scatter-shot approach, investigating patterns in financial statement disclosures, text in annual reports and MD&amp;As, and the nature of journal entries without appropriate guidance being drawn from lessons in known fraud patterns. To develop structure to research in data mining, we create a taxonomy that combines research on patterns of observed fraud schemes with an appreciation of areas that benefit from productive application of data mining. We encapsulate traditional views of data mining that operates primarily on quantitative data, such as financial statement and journal entry data. In addition, we draw on other forms of data mining, notably text and email mining. },

The original purpose of financial instruments was to act as transfer channels for funds between investors and businesses. The purpose of financial instruments has expanded from funding to risk diversification. Although certain derivatives and insurance contracts have been around for centuries, the increased volatility in the financial system introduced in the 1970s set in motion an explosion of product development. Financial instruments used to exist to move money through time backward and forward. Although the occasional crash still instills some modesty into the best of financial engineers, instruments can be tailored to client profiles and to an investor's needs and objectives and current portfolio. Many types of exposure can now be priced and traded, and products can often be tailor-made against an investor's portfolios and desired exposure. A useful categorization of financial instruments, both in terms of processing as well as for risk measurement, is looking at the cash flows. },

The various states and professional organizations are attempting to mitigate investment risks with regulations and methodology instructions, and, thus inspiring new confidence, to kick-start financing, which is the engine driving the real estate market. New methods and approaches are necessary in the area of real estate appraisal also, to ensure that the market value of works in progress could be accurately determined at all times, thereby facilitating the management of risks and reinforcing the confidence of the investors. The author of the article reviews and evaluates the methods with which the value of works in progress can be estimated well, and which can replace the static, simplistic approach currently used by appraisers. While comparative methodology is not suitable to tackle the problem, as the first practical step, in the net replacement cost based valuation approach the Market Value of the land, as value-forming factor, must continuously be examined. The income-based calculation approach can easily be made suitable for the determination of the Market Value of works in progress. },

This paper discusses some of these security concerns for outsourcing. In particular, it discusses security issues pertaining to data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service models as well as supply chain security issues. Relevant standards for data outsourcing are also presented. The goal is for the composite system to be secure even if the individual components that are developed by multiple organizations might be compromised. },

  Abstract                 = {Prior research has investigated organizational adoption of inter-organizational Information Technology (IT) using the Technological–Organizational–Environmental (TOE) framework. While that research has yielded important insights into the adoption of inter-organizational IT, new technologies, such as XBRL, can be used inter-organizationally or internally. As such, testing the \{TOE\} framework in both an internal and inter-organizational context is vital because the independent variables explaining internal adoption may be different from those explaining inter-organizational adoption. Using \{XBRL\} as a representative example, the \{TOE\} framework is used in this study to investigate \{XBRL\} adoption for both internal and inter-organizational purposes. The results suggest that the drivers of internal adoption differ from those of inter-organizational adoption. Based on these results, we encourage future research to consider whether the significance of technological, organizational, and environmental variables change based on whether a technology is adopted internally or inter-organizationally. From a practical perspective, the findings can help professional associations encourage adoption of XBRL. },

Business process standards are developed to provide a common understanding of the information shared between trading partners. These standards, however, mainly capture the syntax of the transactions and not their semantics. This paper proposes the use of ontologies as the basis for standards development and presents an ontology for the ebXML Business Process Specification Schema (ebBP) with the aim of empowering the capture and sharing of semantics embedded within \{B2B\} processes as well as enabling knowledge deduction and reasoning over the shared knowledge. The paper utilises the Ontology-based Standards Development methodology (OntoStanD) as a methodological approach for designing ontological models of standards. This research demonstrates how Semantic Web technologies can be utilised as a basis for standards development and representation in order to improve standards-based interoperability between trading partners. },

  Abstract                 = {In the past, many activities of accounting professors were restricted or confined by their classroom walls. Bringing in guest speakers, taking students on field trips and teaching students off-campus (either locally or globally) were extraordinary efforts that required significant organization. Today, numerous technological advancements in communication infrastructure, equipment and online tools greatly facilitate such initiatives. Outside experts can now visit the classroom, students can explore or collaborate in distant places and professors can extend the geographical reach of their lessons simply via the means of digital video technology. Based on our 2010 Conference on Teaching and Learning in Accounting (CTLA) Master Class, we share our experiences in exploring the use of digital video in teaching accounting and explain how numerous accounting professors are taking advantage of the capabilities afforded by digital video technologies. Online video clips, student video projects, and online video lecture recordings hold great promise for accounting education. We have created a website that complements and demonstrates the teaching ideas presented in this article and that facilitates video integration into accounting courses. We discuss the pedagogical benefits of using video, including those from general education and accounting literature. The article concludes with suggestions for how accounting faculty can keep current with video technology, areas for future accounting research and a call to action for accounting educators. Our work with digital video technology has led to the 2011 American Accounting Association (AAA) Innovation in Accounting Education Award as well as the 2010 Canadian Academic Accounting Association (CAAA) Howard Teall Innovation in Accounting Education Award. },

Using 100 top public listed companies as the sample study, this study examines whether these companies have adopted XBRL, consistent with the call made by the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) for such adoption. Such call was made to encourage listed public companies to provide their annual reports via \{XBRL\} and ultimately improves harmonisation between companies and between countries. The result of this study shows that to this date, no public listed companies have adopted XBRL. Such scenario indicates that there could be issues and challenges that have deter the implementation of \{XBRL\} among these companies. The result in this study serves as a starting point for \{CCM\} and other Malaysian regulators to consider the issues and challenges as to why such scenario exists and subsequently, provide strategies to encourage these companies to adopt XBRL. },

  Abstract                 = {Process mining aims to extract knowledge from the event logs maintained by a company's \{ERP\} system. The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data—data entered independently of the actions of auditee—and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing practice become feasible. },

While pursuing both objectives, governments face a major challenge—to operate in a connected environment, engage stakeholders and solve societal problems by utilizing new methods, tools, practices and governance models. As result, fundamental changes are taking place on how government operates. Such changes are under the larger umbrella of ‘lean government’ (l-Government). Lean government is a new wave which is appearing as a response to traditional approaches—like electronic government (e-Government) and transformational government (t-Government), and aims at reducing the complexity of the public sector by simplifying and streamlining organizational structures and processes, at the same time at stimulating innovation by mobilizing stakeholders. In l-Government, public organizations introduce platforms facilitating innovation and interactions with other public organizations, business and citizens, and focus on their orchestration role. Experimentation, assessment and gradual improvement based on user requirements are key factors for realizing l-Government. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study advances our understanding of the current financial close process. Attention to the topic is warranted for four reasons. First, economic volatility and growth in restatements have increased pressure on companies to report performance timely, completely, and accurately to market participants. Second, recent regulations have increased the workload for accountants at period end thus negatively impacting the efficiency of the close process. Third, several \{SEC\} filings have contained control weaknesses related to the financial close process. Finally, academic research suggests that the time needed to complete the financial close process may serve as a proxy for a company's internal information environment quality. We draw upon prior research and conduct a field investigation with corporate financial officers from 22 different organizations to examine the role of four factors – need to meet expectations, collaboration among multiple participants, estimation process, and ability to incorporate new regulations – in the financial close process. Results suggest that researchers should examine further how the need to meet (or beat) expectations impacts management's actions and the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. Future work could also explore how hidden profile task research and technology advances may improve the financial close process. Finally, research needs to examine how ex post estimate analysis may improve not only estimate quality but also the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. },

Interactive data visualization (IDV) facilitates this process by allowing users to navigate, select, and display data via an easy-to-use interface often used as a component of data analytics. Given the increasing popularity of \{IDV\} as a tool for making sense of complex data, it is important that accountants become familiar with and learn how to use this technology. This case provides a hands-on opportunity to organize complex accounting data to create \{IDVs\} for decision makers to use. Further, the case enables students to understand the potential impact of \{IDVs\} on preparers and users of accounting information. Students will assume the role of a division controller in a hypothetical company and create an \{IDV\} to assist the chief executive officer (CEO) in decision making. },

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary Industry standards are created after extensive discussion between experienced industry players and are helpful in reducing errors, managing risk, and increasing efficiency and productivity. If they are published free of license fees, they are known as open standards. For a straight through processing (STP) environment, three types of standards are relevant that include business standards, technology standards, and financial ontologies. This chapter focuses on financial technology standards relevant to creating an \{STP\} environment. It introduces financial technology protocols and discusses the value of using industry standards for electronic communication of trade data. Currently, three industry standards, FIX, FpML, and SWIFT, are used for system communication of financial data in the securities industry. Firms build their own communication vocabularies for exchanging financial data, and in order to use industry standards, they must build translators that can convert the industry format and vocabulary to their legacy ones. An insight is provided into how firms contribute to, transform, and extend industry standards to meet their own needs. The move toward industry standards is crucial for achieving \{STP\} in the trade lifecycle, and more and more firms are adopting one of these ontologies for interfirm communication. However, concern remains over which format to use for high-speed high-volume trade and market data, and firms struggle to translate industry standards to their internal legacy data formats. },

Utilising semi-structured interviews combined with a questionnaire survey, this paper explores the possible implications of developments in e-business audit for financial auditors as a professional group. The findings suggest that the traditional authority enjoyed by external financial auditors is being, and will be, increasingly challenged by \{IT\} audit specialists. The role of the professional bodies, responsible for the education and training of financial audit professionals, in particular, is highlighted as key to the outcome if they are to fend off challenges in this growing arena and retain jurisdictional control. },

As various initiatives trying to address how the underlying business information should be modelled, named and structured are being realised throughout the world, the importance of moving towards a holistic approach in eBusiness magnifies. In this paper, an attempt to clarify between the standards prevailing in the area is performed and the \{XML\} Data Standards providing generic \{XML\} Schemas are presented. Based on this “XML Data Standards Map”, a multi-faceted classification mechanism is proposed, leading to an extensible taxonomy of standards. A set of facets is analyzed for each standard, allowing for their classification based on their scope, completeness, compatibility with other standards, openness, ability to modify the schemas and maturity, to name a few. Through populating and querying this multi-faceted classification, a common understanding of Data Integration Standards can be ensured and the choice of a standard according to the requirements of each business can be systematically addressed. },

Our empirical results demonstrate a significant positive association between mandatory \{XBRL\} adoption and both analyst following and forecast accuracy. In addition, our findings show that such an association is stronger for Phase I filers than for Phase \{II\} filers in 2010. The magnitude of the association between \{XBRL\} mandate and analyst following is also larger for Phase I filers in year two than in year one of adoption. Our findings not only support the SEC’s requirement of detailed tagging of footnotes but also show that the benefits of adopting \{XBRL\} are realized regardless of errors found and concerns raised at the early stage of adoption. },

  Abstract                 = {The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States mandated a new digital reporting system for \{US\} companies in late 2008. The new generation of information provision has been dubbed by Chairman Cox, ‘interactive data’ (SEC, 2006a). Despite the promise of its name, we find that in the development of the project retail investors are invoked as calculative actors rather than engaged in dialogue. Similarly, the potential for the underlying technology to be applied in ways to encourage new forms of accountability appears to be forfeited in the interests of enrolling company filers. We theorise the activities of the \{SEC\} and in particular its chairman at the time, Christopher Cox, over a three year period, both prior to and following the ‘credit crisis’. We argue that individuals and institutions play a central role in advancing the socio-technical project that is constituted by interactive data. We adopt insights from \{ANT\} (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 2005b) and governmentality (Miller, 2008; Miller and Rose, 2008) to show how regulators and the proponents of the technology have acted as spokespersons for the interactive data technology and the retail investor. We examine the way in which calculative accountability has been privileged in the SEC's construction of the retail investor as concerned with atomised, quantitative data (Kamuf, 2007; Roberts, 2009; Tsoukas, 1997). We find that the possibilities for the democratising effects of digital information on the Internet has not been realised in the interactive data project and that it contains risks for the very investors the \{SEC\} claims to seek to protect. },

They also believe that a general practioner, which we will call a solution architect, is qualified and appropriate to address the complexities across a wide array of technology areas. In reality, this is equivalent to staffing a medical center primarily with general practioners that act as the specialists. A healthy organization maintains top specialists with which the general practioners can participate in getting expertise that is in alignment with a future state vision that reduces complexity and costs. },

These financial data sources are characterized by the use of disparate data models and their unstructured content with implicit knowledge. In addition, the most up-to-date financial information typically resides in the vast amount of financial-related news that brokers take into account when investing. As Semantic Technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable basis for the development of superior, more precise mechanisms to deal with heterogeneous data. In this paper, we present a financial news semantic search engine based on Semantic Web technologies. The search engine is accompanied by an ontology population tool that assists in keeping the financial ontology up-to-date. In addition, a further module has been developed that is capable of crawling the Web in search of financial news and annotating it with knowledge entities from the financial ontology that match with the contents of the news. Our contribution is an overall solution based on a fully fledged architecture that has been validated in a use case scenario for the Spanish stock exchange. },

The main objective of this project is to improve the quality of the core project documentation that serves for supporting the construction works in Spain and to facilitate an efficient exchange of information between the stakeholders in the Spanish Architectural Engineering and Construction sector, in particular their relationship with the Professional Associations and Spanish control public bodies. Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, \{XBRL\} (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of \{XBRL\} taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, digital stamping, delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities. Our proposal can be extended to other countries, particularly in Europe, since regulations are becoming similar in all \{EU\} countries. The potential for spin-off technology utilization is also significant in the areas of insurance, inspection chamber, digital reporting and project management. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract With the diffusion of easy-to-use Web 2.0 tools, such as podcasts, blogs and wikis, e-learning has become a popular mechanism for individual training. While individuals use these tools in the hope that their training will improve their performance, this relationship is not a given. This paper proposes that an individual's level of digital literacy affects her performance through its impact on her performance and effort expectations. To explain the influence of digital literacy on the intention of individuals to continue using e-learning and their performance, we integrate the concept of digital literacy with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and test our model using survey data from New Zealand accountants working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results indicate that these relationships were significant: digital literacy on users' performance and effort expectations, performance expectations on users' intentions to continue using Web 2.0 tools, and continuance intention on performance. These findings suggest that individual digital literacy facilitates the use of e-learning, and should be considered when examining the impact of the latter on performance. },

Within these structures, the implicit requirements of material and financial resources have to meet the imperative of adequate intellectual capital, human resource, - allocation. Neglecting the positive effect of profound \{SWOT\} analysis in risks’ long-term interaction with consonant efforts’ allocation, led to bankruptcy of individual businesses and local economies. Engineering the organizations is a way of redesigning the constitutive structures according to the dynamics of the business’ environment and looking to improve the market value for the firms involved in the general functioning of the economic and financial mechanisms. The means used in businesses’ re-engineering makes a creative use of the advantages of the new IT&amp;C when implemented in computer networks. },

At the same time, Open Data initiatives have contributed relevant financial, economic, and business data to the pool of publicly available information on the Web but the use of \{XBRL\} in combination with Open Data remains at an early state of realisation. In this paper we argue that Linked Data technology, created for Web scale information integration, can accommodate \{XBRL\} data and make it easier to combine it with open datasets. This can provide the foundations for a global data ecosystem of interlinked and interoperable financial and business information with the potential to leverage \{XBRL\} beyond its current regulatory and disclosure role. We outline the uses of Linked Data technologies to facilitate \{XBRL\} consumption in conjunction with non-XBRL Open Data, report on current activities and highlight remaining challenges in terms of information consolidation faced by both \{XBRL\} and Web technologies. },

A total of 451 individuals participated in an experiment. The partial least squares technique was applied to data collected via a questionnaire to test the proposed model. The results indicate that online purchase intention depends on perceived value and trust. The main predictors of perceived trust are perceived information quality and perceived security. Consumers' perceived security depends on vendor reputation, website investment, third-party assurance seals, understanding of third-party seals, privacy and security policies, familiarity with the website, Internet privacy concerns, and disposition towards third-party certification. },

In this paper, we examine whether early and voluntary filers of financial information in \{XBRL\} format demonstrate superior corporate governance and operating performance relative to their non-adopting peers. We investigate performance, market, and structure-related firm variables. Our results suggest that corporate governance is significantly and positively associated with a firm's decision to be an early and voluntary filer of financial information in \{XBRL\} format. At the same time, firm performance factors including liquidity and firm size are also associated with the early and voluntary \{XBRL\} filing decision. Our findings should be particularly interesting for the SEC, as it considers the corporate governance and firm-performance related associations between certain registrants' early and voluntary response and its call for XBRL-based filings. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Impact sourcing – the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing jobs to marginalized individuals – is an important emerging social innovation in the outsourcing industry. The impact sourcing model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus has led to the ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce research about how impact sourcing companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact sourcing companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of impact sourcing companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It also emphasizes the role of ‘social’ encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which impact sourcing companies are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The governance of financial markets in the U.S. is structured around financial products which in some cases results in overlapping regulatory responsibility, intricate and complicated relationships among the various parties and role confusion. These intricate relationships are often complicated by informal and ad-hoc information sharing practices across the regulators. This situation has been recognized as contributing to financial market risks and limiting the potential of smart disclosure policies to benefit financial market stakeholders. This paper adapts an existing framework for information sharing and integration to the complex environment of financial market regulation (FMR) to present an argument for the criticality of effective cross-boundary information sharing to financial regulators seeking to establish robust governance of financial markets. The framework is then used to outline the challenges to information sharing and integration in \{FMR\} and to help model the related information flows. Current literature and a recent study of information sharing in \{FMR\} are used to identify key actors in \{FMR\} information sharing relationships to outline the challenges faced in this unique context and the resulting risk if these challenges go unaddressed. In addition, this paper showcases an example of smart financial apps to illustrate the potential impact of information sharing and integration challenges on smart disclosure policies. },

Using a composite disclosure index this study investigates the status of the non-financial disclosure practices of the top 100 companies operating in Greece. A number of determinants which potentially drive Greek firms to publicly disclose such information are examined, an investigation of the reporting practices of a subgroup of firms which is on the spotlight regarding their environmental performance is performed, while overlapping perspectives for the Greek case are outlined. The analysis suggests that only a small group of leading Greek firms appears to endorse a meaningful business-and-society dialogue as an instrument for stakeholder communication and the discharging of organizational accountability. Most other corporations still tend to treat such practices superficially and in an imprecise manner. },

The core motivation for an ontology representation is the enhanced potential for integrated analytic applications that build on quantitative reporting data combined with structured and unstructured data from additional sources. Applications of this kind will enable significant enhancements in regulatory compliance management, as they enable business analytics combined with inference engines for statistical, but also for logical inferences. In order to define a suitable ontology representation of business reporting language structures, an analysis of the logical principles of the reporting metadata taxonomies and further classification systems is presented. Based on this analysis, a representation of the generally accepted accounting principles taxonomies in \{XBRL\} by an ontology provided in the web ontology language (OWL) is proposed. An additional advantage of this representation is its compliance with the recent ontology definition metamodel (ODM) standard issued by OMG. },

  Abstract                 = {\{XBRL\} stands for extensible business reporting language. It is an \{XML\} based computer language for reporting business information. In December 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) voted to require public filers to provide a supplemental exhibit of their financial statements (including footnotes) in XBRL, with the approximately top 500 public companies required to comply with this new requirement starting June 15, 2009, and the phase-in of this requirement for the other filers to be completed on June 15, 2011. The file created using the \{XRBL\} language is called an \{XBRL\} instance document. Under this requirement, the filers are not required to obtain a third party assurance on the \{XBRL\} instance document. The main reason for not requiring a third party independent assurance of \{XBRL\} instance documents is to encourage filers to comply with the \{SEC\} requirement without incurring much added costs. In addition, to encourage the filers to comply with this requirement, the \{SEC\} is not holding filers legally liable of any errors in the filed \{XBRL\} instance documents so long as they look similar to the standard reports when viewed using the \{SEC\} viewer. Even though the \{SEC\} is not currently requiring a third party assurance of the \{XBRL\} instance documents of the \{SEC\} filings, it is in the best interest of the public that these documents be assured. Although there have been efforts by both the practitioners and academics to investigate issues involved in providing assurance on \{XBRL\} documents, these efforts have been focused on the specifics of the assurance process and the difficulties involved in it, and not on developing a framework of assertions. Even the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recent publication \{SOP\} 09-1 provides only an illustrative list of management assertions for handling the XBRL-tagging engagements under the \{SSAEs\} as agreed-upon procedures without considering a framework. Without a conceptual framework, the assurance process for \{XBRL\} instance document would be ad hoc and inconsistent. This paper develops a set of assertions for providing assurance on \{XBRL\} instance documents similar to the management assertions for financial audits. Further, we discuss how such a framework would assist auditors in planning and evaluating such an engagement by collecting appropriate items of evidence pertaining to specific assertions to form an opinion whether the instance document is a true representation of the standard format (i.e., \{ASCII\} or HTML) document. We also discuss how the use of new technology would make the assurance process more effective and efficient. },

  Abstract                 = {The importance of information technology (IT) auditing has grown with increased reliance on \{IT\} for business operations and new regulations regarding the assurance of \{IT\} for these operations. Prior work on \{IT\} and financial auditing has suggested several general frameworks that may affect \{IT\} audit quality; however, the prior work has not provided measurable constructs nor has it considered whether these proposed constructs are the same or different. Building on prior work that has proposed frameworks of \{IT\} audit quality, we identify and evaluate potential constructs suggested by these frameworks as well as financial auditing literature. We develop a survey tool and ask \{IT\} and financial accounting practitioners to assess the impact of these items on \{IT\} audit quality. A factor analysis is used to refine the set of \{IT\} audit quality factors identified, and we are able to provide insight into the prioritized impact of each factor on \{IT\} audit quality. In comparison to prior research, we find that additional factors are significant for \{IT\} audit quality and that the relative importance of the factors for \{IT\} audit quality differs for \{IT\} versus financial auditors. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this article we theorize and conceptualize the recent convergence of management accounting (MA) and financial accounting (FA) with the advancements in information technology (IT), and explicate not only how this convergence is manifested in the technical and technological domain, but also how it is reflected in their convergence at the behavioral and organizational level. Drawing on the analytical model by Hemmer and Labro (2008), in which the forward-looking perspective of \{FA\} leads to forward-looking MA, we build a conceptual framing to analyze this convergence. According to this framing, information technology (IT) serves as a facilitator, catalyst, motivator, or even an enabler for the convergence of \{MA\} and FA. We further argue that convergence is a much broader phenomenon than claimed by Hemmer and Labro. It firstly covers the technical and technological domain, including the intentional integration of information systems and software, as well as the intentional combination of methods or standards, extending thereafter to the behavioral and organizational domain with the (un)intentional alignment regarding both functions and processes as well as the (un)intentional convergence regarding both work and roles. The applicability of this conceptual framing is illustrated with a set of examples. We present illustrations of the manifestations and outcomes of convergence in both the technical and technological domain (related to accounting standards, discretionary reporting, performance measurement, transfer pricing, competitor, customer and contractor analysis, due diligence in M&amp;As), and the behavioral and organizational manifestation domain (related to accounting processes, work and the role of accountants, incentive systems, accounting and control in multinational companies, the control of business networks, the board of directors and venture capitalists). Based on our observations, we conclude that the forward-looking \{FA\} elements are often intertwined with MA, and vice versa, and that convergence in the technical and technological domain appears to precede convergence in the behavioral and organizational domain. In most of our observations, \{IT\} plays an important or even crucial role in this convergence process. In the light of these convergence observations, we open several avenues for further research. },

Traditionally, enterprises require financial or non-financial reporting based on quarterly and annual periods. Yet, the rapid change that occurs on market and society causes this periodic reporting to become quickly outdated. Higher competition among enterprises demands for more updated information to enable management to rapidly adapt to opportunities and answer problems. Real-time accounting addresses these needs, but needs new technological answers. In this article we present some technologies which can help the implementation of real-time accounting, namely, business process management, mobile devices, cloud computing, business intelligence, enterprise architecture and enterprise application integration. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for the identification of an organization’s intellectual capital (IC) for decision support and providing important managerial insights in knowledge-intensive industries. In traditional approaches, identification of an organization’s \{IC\} is usually done manually through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc. These methods are labor and time intensive and the quality of the results is highly dependent on, among other things, the experience of the investigators. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Intellectual Capital Extraction (KBICE) algorithm which incorporates the technologies of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic processing of unstructured data and extraction of important IC-related information. The performance of \{KBICE\} was assessed through a series of experiments conducted by using publicly available financial reports from the banking industry as the testing batch and encouraging results have been obtained. The results showed that, through the use of hybrid intelligent matching strategies, it is possible to extract commonly referred IC-related information from unstructured data automatically. \{IC\} information analyst can rely on this method as an additional mean to identify and extract the commonly sought \{IC\} information from financial reports in a fast, systematic and reliable manner. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Industrial product service systems (IPS2) are holistic, innovative and customer individual problem solutions. An \{IPS2\} includes integratively developed product and service modules. The integrative character challenges the \{IPS2\} development by steering interactions between people from different disciplines (product and service) within the provider's company. Further, the provision of \{IPS2\} requires various competences. Consequently, the \{IPS2\} provider needs cooperation partners in order to fill competence gaps and to concentrate on own core competencies. This kind of interaction has also to be steered target-oriented. Further, the long duration of \{IPS2\} business relationships and incomplete information about future changes cause uncertainty in the decision making along the \{IPS2\} lifecycle. An innovative method for steering interactions and dealing with uncertainty is the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The goal of the \{ICS\} is the early detection and target-oriented development of intangible innovation and success potentials. It goes beyond the traditional financial balance sheet and focuses on three kinds of capital, namely human capital, structural capital and relational capital. As the \{ICS\} focuses on intangibles, its application to the \{IPS2\} context appears reasonable. The main difference by using \{ICS\} for \{IPS2\} is that this method is dimensioned for companies as well as single departments. The challenge is to transfer the \{ICS\} from the system boundary of one firm to an \{IPS2\} and therefore to a network of companies. This paper gives answers to the questions why an \{ICS\} is necessary in the context of \{IPS2\} and what adjustments are required in order to adapt \{ICS\} for IPS2. },

The Delphi method is especially useful in reducing ambiguity through the use of expert panels of both practitioners and experts and informing relevant and timely issues facing organizations. In essence, the Delphi method has potential to provide both rigor and relevance to \{AIS\} researchers. Our purpose is to review the prior literature on the use of the Delphi method and discuss potential areas of research within the \{AIS\} discipline where the method might add value. Based on this review, we develop a series of guidelines on how to properly develop, administer, and assess panel responses and then use an illustrative study example that explores \{IT\} risks in operations. We conclude with a discussion of the value of the Delphi method and provide insight into its limitations. },

Valuable insights into the perceptions of professional end users toward a component of a complex technology were gained. Recommendations based upon the results of this study include: (a) clearly describe, early in the implementation process, an overall picture of the \{ERP\} system flow and visually show end users how the components they use “fit” into the whole system; (b) convert ERP-related “tech talk” to common end user language by either clear explanation of unique terms or associations of new terms to ones commonly understood by end users, and (c) provide adequate resources (financial, physical, human, etc.) to ensure that end users have access to timely support. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Data standards are often used by multiple organizations to produce and exchange data. Given the high cost of developing data standards and their significant impact on the interoperability of data produced using the standards, the quality of data standards must be systematically measured. We develop a framework for systematically assessing the quality of large-scale data standards using automated tools. It consists of metrics for intrinsic and contextual quality dimensions, as well as effectual metrics that assess the extent to which a standard enables data interoperability. We evaluate the quality assessment framework using two versions of a large financial reporting standard, the \{US\} \{GAAP\} Taxonomy, and public companies' financial statements created using the Taxonomy. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the framework. Findings from the evaluation also offer valuable insights to decision makers who develop and improve data standards, select and adopt data standards, or consume standards-based data. },
