  Abstract                 = {Business reports are changing in response to regulatory and market demands. Requests by regulators for electronic filings of financial statements and tax forms are increasing and such filings are rapidly becoming mandatory in many countries. In response, extensible business reporting language (XBRL) is a market-driven, collaborative effort to make electronic filings more useful to, and to reduce the burden on, both publishers and consumers of business reports. XBRL does much more than simply list data items that can be submitted in an electronic filing. XBRL is a complete set of tools for regulators or groups to fully communicate the meanings of and interrelationships among the business reporting concepts. In addition, core sets of concepts from regulators or groups can be extended, expanded, or otherwise modified for more specific communication by jurisdictions, industries, or individual corporations. This unique customization capability lets companies better present their electronic filings as parallels to their paper filings. A "customizable standard" offers new opportunities and new challenges. This paper discusses XBRL's paradoxical power - the trade-offs between customizing to better parallel existing paper reports and compromising to more closely match the standards, and the research needed for the transition from freeform to customized reports.},

  Abstract                 = {With the January 2009 mandate by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of Interactive Data, as well as other governmental mandates and opportunities for compliance burden reductions globally, the Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is becoming a more common and necessary part of corporate governance and compliance. Due to this external pressure, as well as the primary focus of XBRL advocates themselves to encourage governmental adoption of XBRL for compliance reporting, another important deliverable from XBRL International, Inc.- XBRL's Global Ledger Framework (XBRL GL)- and its obvious and immediate benefits to organisations has been given much less visibility than the external focused efforts; however, XBRL GL has the potential to bring more measurable benefit to companies, in addition to helping support the benefits regulators and the markets receive from more transparent external reporting. XBRL GL serves as a metadata hub (to facilitate system interoperability), as a common face to data from different systems (facilitating common toolsets and controls) and as a tool to enable a seamless audit trail, spanning gaps between systems. XBRL GL seamlessly integrates incoming transactions and external facing reports, acting as a bridge, a single, holistic, generic view of data. While companies can continue to choose proprietary approaches, and while the XBRL Specification itself is sometimes used as the basis for those approaches, it is a proper combination of XBRL GL with XBRL for external reporting that may offer the greatest benefit to companies. While XBRL GL has some obvious potential benefits, the risk to companies and to the market as a whole is that lack of adoption of XBRL GL will lead to a proliferation of proprietary standards at different points in the Business Reporting Supply Chain and for different consumers, such as the world's tax regulators, leading to more confusion and burden instead of providing holistic solutions that provide benefits for all. Those responsible for corporate governance have a responsibility to make sure that interoperability solutions are being chosen with an eye on long-term value, and not just the easiest solution in the short term. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.},

  Abstract                 = {The XML Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a standard for business and financial information reporting. It is based on XML so instance documents based on XBRL, e.g. a quarterly report, are highly constrained by the XML document-oriented nature. This makes more difficult to perform queries that mix information from filings from different dates, companies, or accounting principles than with a formalism based on a graph model instead of a tree model. Semantic Web technologies provide a graph model that facilitates mashing-up different XBRL sources. We have put into practice this approach mapping the XBRL filings available from the SEC's EDGAR program to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the XML Schema taxonomies these filings are based on to Web Ontology Language (OWL). The resulting semantic metadata, though highly tied to the XML structure it is mapped from, benefits from Semantic Web technologies and tools in order to facilitate integration and cross-querying, even together with other parts of the Web of Linked Data.},

  Abstract                 = {Irregular activities such as fraud often lead to recurring, identifiable patterns in the meta-information. Such patterns may be automatically identified by means of a grammatical rule set which uses compiler construction techniques to identify the origin of the irregularity and the pattern associated with it. The eXtensible Modelling Language (XML) is often used to facilitate inter-operation of applications. Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is based on the concept of XML and is an open, human readable format designed for the sharing of financial information. Due the ease of editing and modifying human readable information, it is comparatively easy to manipulate the information contained in XBRL in a fraudulent way. An example might be to edit the totals of a transaction or to add a bogus transaction to the data. Our research addresses this problem by applying compiler construction techniques on the XBRL information. In doing so, we hope to extract useful forensic information from the patterns in the meta-information which may in turn be used for prosecution in case of irregularities (such as fraud). Our techniques can be further applied to other XML based applications (such as command and control XML specifications) to detect irregularities in a post-event analysis. The paper reports on a prototype that was constructed using standard compiler construction tools such as Lex and Yacc under Linux. We have used these tools to construct a grammar and to compile the grammar into an executable. The executable was then run on a set of XBRL inputs, where it performed pattern matching on the meta-information in the XBRL input. The parser was generated to parse correct XBRL; the 'normal' productions that form part of correct XBRL were augmented by error productions to deal with a few examples of fraudulent actions. The prototype was able to identify pre-defined fraud patterns in the XBRL-file. It is thus possible to conclude that grammar rules and compiler construction can be used to successfully parse meta-information and extract forensic information.},

Moreover, tools such as XBRL have been developed to deal with the automatic generation of business reports. However the available tools are not suitable to sup-port the current tendency towards the so called, Continuous Reporting. Here, for a specific purpose, the wealth of available information should be summarized in short reports where the relevant information is remarked while the irrelevant remains hidden. Using a combination of Zadeh's Computational Theory of Perceptions and Semantic Web techniques, we propose a first approach to a computational framework to generate short reports that consist of few but meaningful Natural Language sentences. These sentences are designed to solve the user needs in a specific context of meaning defined with the help of an ontology. A practical demonstration of the computational framework is included.©2010 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Businesses continually invest in new information technologies (IT) for improved reporting. EXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is an example of IT that allows financial statements to be transmitted and analysed electronically. The international business community has shown strong support for XBRL, with several countries mandating financial reporting using XBRL. However, even though organisations may be required to transmit XBRL-formatted financial statements, users of such statements would still need to choose whether or not they wish to analyse them with XBRL-enabled analysis tools. Earlier research indicates that the individual user's perceptions of IT tools are frequently negatively biased and that IT tools are commonly underused as a result. If this general finding were to be true for XBRL use, it could seriously affect XBRL's diffusion into the business community. The authors, both CPAs and accounting professors, investigate the relationship between XBRL use and perception by surveying 61 MBA students as proxies for nonprofessional investors. Results indicate that although perceptions of XBRL are generally positive, increased use of XBRL leads to more positive perceptions. Thus, organisations promoting the spread of XBRL should consider making access to XBRL analysis tools as easy and widely available as possible. Additionally, organisations that issue XBRL-formatted reports are perceived more positively than ones that do not issue such reports (a halo effect). © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.},

  Abstract                 = {Financial statements are not as important to investors as they once were, as technology has changed the way companies create value today. While these changes pose serious threats to the economic viability of auditing, they also create new opportunities for auditors to pursue. Both the American Institute of Certified of Public Accountants and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Task Force on Assurance Services have identified continuous auditing as a service that should be offered. Continuous auditing is significantly different from an annual financial statement audit. A latest research report produced by the CICA defines a continuous audit as: "a methodology that enables independent auditors to provide written assurance on a subject matter using a series of auditors' reports issued simultaneously with, or a short period of time after, the occurrence of events underlying the subject matter." However, continuous auditing would present significant technical hurdles. These technical hurdles could be overcome if certain conditions exist. Computer-assisted audit tools (CAATs) are one of the conditions that must exist in order to conduct the continuous auditing. CAATs are defined as computer-assisted tools that permit auditors to increase their productivity, as well as that of the audit function. Therefore, with the real-time accounting and electronic data interchange popularizing, CAATs are becoming even more necessary. The demand for timely and forward-looking information hints that the continuous audit will eventually replace the traditional audit report on year-end results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},
