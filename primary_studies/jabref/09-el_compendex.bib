Articles are easily navigated with hyperlinks that allow readers to zoom in on the portion of the content of most interest. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also encourages the application of structure to content that was previously viewed as unstructured. The SEC announced that it would begin requiring companies to provide financial statements in eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and all companies will be filing in XBRL by 2011. The impact of global positioning system (GPS) technology is significant such as digital cameras and smartphones are able to geotag the photos and a smartphone have a tool that combines a GPS, a compass, and a camera.

  Abstract                 = {The Basel Capital Agreement (Basel II) required all banking entities actively to manage Operational Risk by means of making explicit measurements and creating specific items in their general ledgers. Currently, the most sophisticated resource for handling transactional information is the XBRL-GL Taxonomy, an electronic dictionary of business elements or digital tags based on eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), the digital mark-up language for financial contexts, which in turn has the special feature of incorporating transactional or Global Ledger (GL) information. This study proposes, in one hand, an extension of that dictionary, to incorporate Operational Risk information, and in the other hand, a simple tool to edit and visualise such reports, called BaselMapper, which is tested with a business expert. Since this experimental tool, BaselMapper, was created in 2007 and validated in 2008, till the publication date of this article, several changes have occurred in both its normative and technical foundations. Due to the financial crisis, the Bank of International Settlements has developed a new set of reforms in banking regulation, beyond the Basel II agreement described here, called Basel III. To consult the current regulatory framework, please visit: http://www.bis.org/bcbs/ basel3.htm Operational Risk aspects were not modified. Additionally, a new version of the XBRLGL taxonomy is now available, called Global Ledger, at: http://www.xbrl.org/GLFiles/that still incorporates the COR-BUS module used here. So, essentially, these changes do not modify the aim of this paper, which is to promote the use of XBRL-enabled technology for Operational Risk measurement in banking institutions at the international level. Further research will be necessary to maintain this tool properly updated, with the substantial participation of more potential users. Copyright &copy; 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The XML Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a standard for business and financial information reporting. It is based on XML so instance documents based on XBRL, e.g. a quarterly report, are highly constrained by the XML document-oriented nature. This makes more difficult to perform queries that mix information from filings from different dates, companies, or accounting principles than with a formalism based on a graph model instead of a tree model. Semantic Web technologies provide a graph model that facilitates mashing-up different XBRL sources. We have put into practice this approach mapping the XBRL filings available from the SEC's EDGAR program to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the XML Schema taxonomies these filings are based on to Web Ontology Language (OWL). The resulting semantic metadata, though highly tied to the XML structure it is mapped from, benefits from Semantic Web technologies and tools in order to facilitate integration and cross-querying, even together with other parts of the Web of Linked Data.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a consensus (Hoffman and Strand, 2001; Hannon, 2002; Bovee et al., 2005; Willis, 2005; Cox, 2006) that XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language) as a technical standard for facilitating transfer and analysis of financial statements could improve the speed and quality of transmitting, analyzing, and even more accurate financial reports by providing machine readable documents. Footnotes, which include important explanations about financial values, have still an unstructured format and are an obstacle for analysts and other stakeholders who want to benefit from analyzing financial statements. It is of interest how data integration approaches can support and facilitate the process of data extraction from footnotes automatically to gain accurate and reasonable analysis to avoid manual tasks. To address this issue, a state of the art is needed to identify and cluster relevant existing methods in terms of structured and unstructured data integration. It is shown that most of the existing literature is focused on a storage level of data integration. Other researchers deal with methods and tools to integrate and analyze structured and unstructured data separately. But, no identified paper illustrates an unstructured data integration solution to support analytical tasks based on XBRL documents. &copy; (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Irregular activities such as fraud often lead to recurring, identifiable patterns in the meta-information. Such patterns may be automatically identified by means of a grammatical rule set which uses compiler construction techniques to identify the origin of the irregularity and the pattern associated with it. The eXtensible Modelling Language (XML) is often used to facilitate inter-operation of applications. Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is based on the concept of XML and is an open, human readable format designed for the sharing of financial information. Due the ease of editing and modifying human readable information, it is comparatively easy to manipulate the information contained in XBRL in a fraudulent way. An example might be to edit the totals of a transaction or to add a bogus transaction to the data. Our research addresses this problem by applying compiler construction techniques on the XBRL information. In doing so, we hope to extract useful forensic information from the patterns in the meta-information which may in turn be used for prosecution in case of irregularities (such as fraud). Our techniques can be further applied to other XML based applications (such as command and control XML specifications) to detect irregularities in a post-event analysis. The paper reports on a prototype that was constructed using standard compiler construction tools such as Lex and Yacc under Linux. We have used these tools to construct a grammar and to compile the grammar into an executable. The executable was then run on a set of XBRL inputs, where it performed pattern matching on the meta-information in the XBRL input. The parser was generated to parse correct XBRL; the 'normal' productions that form part of correct XBRL were augmented by error productions to deal with a few examples of fraudulent actions. The prototype was able to identify pre-defined fraud patterns in the XBRL-file. It is thus possible to conclude that grammar rules and compiler construction can be used to successfully parse meta-information and extract forensic information.},

  Abstract                 = {We are living in a fast changing world, especially in the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) sector. In this difficult environment people like to use buzzwords and acronyms - in the title of this paper you find some of them used a lot in the statistical context. It is no problem to add more: CASI, CSAQ, EDI, XML, XBRL - all of them and many more will appear in this article (and in the glossary). It is not always easy for statisticians and ICT specialists to understand each other. However, ICT is needed to automate statistical data reporting in order to save resources and improve processes - so both communities are condemned to co-operate. In this scenario, a third area with yet another jargon is playing an important role, namely e-business: more and more, statistical EDR is using e-business tools and methods, like for example EDIFACT or ebXML. This paper tries to shed some light on the ICT and e-business aspects of statistical data reporting. The questions addressed in this paper include: What is EDR? What is metadata for EDR? Which metadata standards for EDR are available or coming up? And how is the ESS concerned or involved? The current situation of EDI standardisation is examined in more detail: the transition from EDIFACT to XML and the adoption of ebXML for the ESS.},

Moreover, tools such as XBRL have been developed to deal with the automatic generation of business reports. However the available tools are not suitable to sup-port the current tendency towards the so called, Continuous Reporting. Here, for a specific purpose, the wealth of available information should be summarized in short reports where the relevant information is remarked while the irrelevant remains hidden. Using a combination of Zadeh's Computational Theory of Perceptions and Semantic Web techniques, we propose a first approach to a computational framework to generate short reports that consist of few but meaningful Natural Language sentences. These sentences are designed to solve the user needs in a specific context of meaning defined with the help of an ontology. A practical demonstration of the computational framework is included.&copy;2010 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Financial statements are not as important to investors as they once were, as technology has changed the way companies create value today. While these changes pose serious threats to the economic viability of auditing, they also create new opportunities for auditors to pursue. Both the American Institute of Certified of Public Accountants and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Task Force on Assurance Services have identified continuous auditing as a service that should be offered. Continuous auditing is significantly different from an annual financial statement audit. A latest research report produced by the CICA defines a continuous audit as: "a methodology that enables independent auditors to provide written assurance on a subject matter using a series of auditors' reports issued simultaneously with, or a short period of time after, the occurrence of events underlying the subject matter." However, continuous auditing would present significant technical hurdles. These technical hurdles could be overcome if certain conditions exist. Computer-assisted audit tools (CAATs) are one of the conditions that must exist in order to conduct the continuous auditing. CAATs are defined as computer-assisted tools that permit auditors to increase their productivity, as well as that of the audit function. Therefore, with the real-time accounting and electronic data interchange popularizing, CAATs are becoming even more necessary. The demand for timely and forward-looking information hints that the continuous audit will eventually replace the traditional audit report on year-end results. &copy; Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},
