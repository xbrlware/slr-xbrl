However, semantic heterogeneity across \{XBRL\} filings poses a challenge for individual (non-institutional) investors seeking to make inter-firm comparisons using \{XBRL\} data. In order to extend the benefits of \{XBRL\} to individual investors, this paper presents a design artifact, Ontology-based Framework for XBRL-mapping and Decision-making (OFXD), which provides interoperability between different \{XBRL\} filings. Specifically, \{OFXD\} resolves the semantic heterogeneity of the element and context definitions in various \{XBRL\} filings and generates an \{XBRL\} ontology — XBRLOnt. The results of this study show that the proposed design artifact is capable of addressing semantic heterogeneities between different \{XBRL\} filings. Using the concepts of the information value chain, this paper discusses the implications of \{XBRL\} interoperability on financial decision-making. "

However, much of this information mirrors the paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called ‘first generation’ of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a ‘second generation’ of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability of the data. Documents rendered in \{XBRL\} are digitally-enabled so that it is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability. \{XBRL\} consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of this technology within the business and government communities. However, despite their efforts \{XBRL\} has not become widely diffused, there is little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have voluntarily adopted \{XBRL\} in practice. The results of a questionnaire survey in the \{UK\} indicate that awareness of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the \{XBRL\} community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push for \{XBRL\} is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for \{XBRL\} such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible, repositories of \{XBRL\} data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and \{XBRL\} will fade and die. "

Using a sample from the first wave of mandated \{XBRL\} filers, we find a decline in post earnings announcement drift for the good news portfolio in the post-XBRL adoption period. Instead of a drift associated with underreaction, we find that markets overreact to negative earnings surprises for the bad news portfolio during our observation period, which coincides with the financial crisis. We detect limited evidence that \{XBRL\} adoption mitigates overreaction, which is another form of market inefficiency. We also find limited evidence that \{XBRL\} particularly benefits small investors. "

Then, using traditional financial analysis techniques (ratio analysis) students can compare the performance of these companies. Thus, the project accomplishes two important objectives: it introduces students to the benefits and features of XBRL-tagged financial reporting and interactive data, and it shows how this medium can be used to facilitate the analysis of financial statements. The project uses free, publicly available interactive data tools to accomplish these objectives. This project is appropriate for any level of financial accounting course in which students use public company financial statements to generate financial ratios and conduct analysis on them. We aim the project at MBA-type introductory accounting courses. In addition, we show how it can easily be expanded to be applied to higher level financial statement analysis courses, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The project provides some background into how XBRL-tagged financial reporting is generated, while the main focus is on application of interactive data and not the technology itself. Since \{XBRL\} is now mandated by the \{US\} Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for most reporting entities, it is critical for today’s business students to be familiar with this method of communicating financial information.

It is therefore essential to develop global accounting standards as a unique foundation on which the \{XBRL\} taxonomies can be established, so that it becomes possible to compare the financial information originating from various countries. Along these lines, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS-GP) taxonomy was created to establish a common ground for international firms and create a platform that would enhance the benefits of XBRL. This paper examines whether the IFRS-GP taxonomy, at its current state, adequately covers European companies' dissemination practices and strengthens the benefits of XBRL.

abstract = "\{XBRL\} stands for extensible business reporting language. It is an \{XML\} based computer language for reporting business information. In December 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) voted to require public filers to provide a supplemental exhibit of their financial statements (including footnotes) in XBRL, with the approximately top 500 public companies required to comply with this new requirement starting June 15, 2009, and the phase-in of this requirement for the other filers to be completed on June 15, 2011. The file created using the \{XRBL\} language is called an \{XBRL\} instance document. Under this requirement, the filers are not required to obtain a third party assurance on the \{XBRL\} instance document. The main reason for not requiring a third party independent assurance of \{XBRL\} instance documents is to encourage filers to comply with the \{SEC\} requirement without incurring much added costs. In addition, to encourage the filers to comply with this requirement, the \{SEC\} is not holding filers legally liable of any errors in the filed \{XBRL\} instance documents so long as they look similar to the standard reports when viewed using the \{SEC\} viewer. Even though the \{SEC\} is not currently requiring a third party assurance of the \{XBRL\} instance documents of the \{SEC\} filings, it is in the best interest of the public that these documents be assured. Although there have been efforts by both the practitioners and academics to investigate issues involved in providing assurance on \{XBRL\} documents, these efforts have been focused on the specifics of the assurance process and the difficulties involved in it, and not on developing a framework of assertions. Even the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recent publication \{SOP\} 09-1 provides only an illustrative list of management assertions for handling the XBRL-tagging engagements under the \{SSAEs\} as agreed-upon procedures without considering a framework. Without a conceptual framework, the assurance process for \{XBRL\} instance document would be ad hoc and inconsistent. This paper develops a set of assertions for providing assurance on \{XBRL\} instance documents similar to the management assertions for financial audits. Further, we discuss how such a framework would assist auditors in planning and evaluating such an engagement by collecting appropriate items of evidence pertaining to specific assertions to form an opinion whether the instance document is a true representation of the standard format (i.e., \{ASCII\} or HTML) document. We also discuss how the use of new technology would make the assurance process more effective and efficient. "

In this paper, we examine whether early and voluntary filers of financial information in \{XBRL\} format demonstrate superior corporate governance and operating performance relative to their non-adopting peers. We investigate performance, market, and structure-related firm variables. Our results suggest that corporate governance is significantly and positively associated with a firm's decision to be an early and voluntary filer of financial information in \{XBRL\} format. At the same time, firm performance factors including liquidity and firm size are also associated with the early and voluntary \{XBRL\} filing decision. Our findings should be particularly interesting for the SEC, as it considers the corporate governance and firm-performance related associations between certain registrants' early and voluntary response and its call for XBRL-based filings.

Our empirical results demonstrate a significant positive association between mandatory \{XBRL\} adoption and both analyst following and forecast accuracy. In addition, our findings show that such an association is stronger for Phase I filers than for Phase \{II\} filers in 2010. The magnitude of the association between \{XBRL\} mandate and analyst following is also larger for Phase I filers in year two than in year one of adoption. Our findings not only support the SEC’s requirement of detailed tagging of footnotes but also show that the benefits of adopting \{XBRL\} are realized regardless of errors found and concerns raised at the early stage of adoption.

This paper examines two different \{B2G\} information exchange architectures that reflect continuing transformations that empower some government agencies to do better compliance monitoring tasks with fewer resources. The win for the reporting companies is the lower cost of compliance. Instead of focusing on collecting compliance information from individual companies, the government agencies in this study focus on collecting information on the supply chain level, allowing for automated data reconciliation. Our findings reveal that pushing controls (automated checks) upstream (in company software and data sources) results in more efficiency, higher information quality and reduces redundant controls. The examined architectures exhibit high levels of compliance by design, meaning that many control objectives are by default encompassed in the design. This requires a well-aligned combination of data standardization (using shared syntax and semantics) and automated information processing (using an intelligent gateway between businesses and government agencies). However, achieving such an alignment is a difficult challenge; especially when taking into account that such transformations require solid governance, trust and high initial investments — prerequisites that are rare in many public-private partnerships.

A key aspect of the data quality of these filings is the correctness of the mathematical relationships implied by the taxonomy and implemented in the instance document. One quarter of the filings by the initial 400 large corporations in the first round of submissions had errors, with differences reported monetary facts and the sum of other monetary facts that were bound together in a computation relationship. The primary cause of these errors was inappropriate treatment in the instance documents of underlying debit/credit assumptions in the taxonomy.

abstract = "Abstract A core application of \{XBRL\} is to facilitate the flow of tagged financial statements and annual reports, from companies and other entities directly to the databases, web sites, and computers of regulators, stakeholders and other information consumers. Increasingly, \{XBRL\} provides the technological foundation for the communication of financial information where there is independent assurance. This XBRL-based assurance may be on the financial statements (i.e., an electronically consumable form of today's standard \{PDF\} or \{HTML\} audit report) or focus on the quality of the \{XBRL\} exhibit (i.e., the instance document). Regardless of the type of \{XBRL\} assurance report, maintenance of the security and integrity of the instance document is paramount. This conceptual paper identifies and discusses the communication, security challenges and relevant research issues when there is independent assurance on financial statements formatted in XBRL. Successful electronic communication of assurance to information consumers should clearly distinguish the responsibilities of management (i.e., the financial statements) and the auditor (i.e., the audit report). It is important to have an integrated approach where the assurance report, financial statements and other reports in which facts in the financial statements are incorporated are inextricably tied at the level of automated data consumption. Further, as much as possible, human interaction should be accommodated. The paper sets out a range of alternatives for maintenance of security on the assurance report. "

Such call was made to encourage listed public companies to provide their annual reports via \{XBRL\} and ultimately improves harmonisation between companies and between countries. The result of this study shows that to this date, no public listed companies have adopted XBRL.

Most organizations fail to recognize the need for diverse specialization within architecture because they fail to understand the depth of complexity and the costs associated with mediocrity within each area of specialization. They also believe that a general practioner, which we will call a solution architect, is qualified and appropriate to address the complexities across a wide array of technology areas. In reality, this is equivalent to staffing a medical center primarily with general practioners that act as the specialists. A healthy organization maintains top specialists with which the general practioners can participate in getting expertise that is in alignment with a future state vision that reduces complexity and costs.

To test these conjectures, we refine and employ a comprehensive disclosure evaluation metric to assess both the content and the presentation of these types of disclosures and utilize a firm's America's Toxic 100 toxic score, a newly developed measure based on the \{US\} Environmental Protection Agency's toxics release inventory (TRI) data, to proxy for environmental performance. Based on empirical tests of four size-matched samples, our findings support our conjectures, showing that worse environmental performers provide more extensive disclosure in terms of content and website presentation.

This paper proposes the use of ontologies as the basis for standards development and presents an ontology for the ebXML Business Process Specification Schema (ebBP) with the aim of empowering the capture and sharing of semantics embedded within \{B2B\} processes as well as enabling knowledge deduction and reasoning over the shared knowledge. The paper utilises the Ontology-based Standards Development methodology (OntoStanD) as a methodological approach for designing ontological models of standards.

Applications of this kind will enable significant enhancements in regulatory compliance management, as they enable business analytics combined with inference engines for statistical, but also for logical inferences. In order to define a suitable ontology representation of business reporting language structures, an analysis of the logical principles of the reporting metadata taxonomies and further classification systems is presented. Based on this analysis, a representation of the generally accepted accounting principles taxonomies in \{XBRL\} by an ontology provided in the web ontology language (OWL) is proposed.

They are used by relatively small groups of users consisting of information analysts and power users, for whom data and analysis are their primary jobs. We present an ontology-based approach for \{BI\} applications, specifically in statistical analysis and data mining. We implemented our approach in financial knowledge management system (FKMS), which is able to do: (i) data extraction, transformation and loading, (ii) data cubes creation and retrieval, (iii) statistical analysis and data mining, (iv) experiment metadata management, (v) experiment retrieval for new problem solving. The resulting knowledge from each experiment defined as a knowledge set consisting of strings of data, model, parameters, and reports are stored, shared, disseminated, and thus helpful to support decision making. We finally illustrate the above claims with a process of applying data mining techniques to support corporate bonds classification. "

Higher competition among enterprises demands for more updated information to enable management to rapidly adapt to opportunities and answer problems.

Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, \{XBRL\} (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of \{XBRL\} taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, digital stamping, delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities.

This paper canvasses perspectives on applying data mining techniques to journal entries. In the past, the impediment to researching journal entry data mining is getting access to journal entry data sets, which may explain why the published research in this area is a null set. For this project, we had access to journal entry data sets for 29 different organizations. Our initial exploratory test of the data sets had interesting preliminary findings. (1) For all 29 entities, the distribution of first digits of journal dollar amounts differed from that expected by Benford's Law. (2) Regarding last digits, unlike first digits, which are expected to have a logarithmic distribution, the last digits would be expected to have a uniform distribution. Our test found that the distribution was not uniform for many of the entities. In fact, eight entities had one number whose frequency was three times more than expected. (3) We compared the number of accounts related to the top five most frequently occurring three last digit combinations. Four entities had a very high occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved only a small set of accounts, one entity had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combination that involved a large set of accounts and 24 had a low occurrences of the most frequent three digit combinations that involved a small set of accounts. In general, the first four entities would probably pose the highest risk of fraud because it could indicate that the fraudster is covering up or falsifying a particular class of transactions. In the future, we will apply more data mining techniques to discover other patterns and relationships in the data sets. We also want to seed the dataset with fraud indicators (e.g., pairs of accounts that would not be expected in a journal entry) and compare the sensitivity of the different data mining techniques to find these seeded indicators.

In these circumstances, we put forward a paradigm for \{AIS\} research based on the principle of comparative advantage, which is the powerful economic force that ensures that trade can take place even between parties where one has an absolute superiority over the other. It is our contention that if \{AIS\} academics are to succeed in creating value added research then they have to identify what they can do that the \{AIS\} industry, despite all its financial and human resource advantages, cannot or will not do. And what economic theory indicates is that such opportunities to add value always exist — if only academics are willing to seek them out. We illustrate our paradigm by analyzing three potential sources of comparative advantage for \{AIS\} researchers and discussing illustrative examples of research in each of these areas. "

First, economic volatility and growth in restatements have increased pressure on companies to report performance timely, completely, and accurately to market participants. Second, recent regulations have increased the workload for accountants at period end thus negatively impacting the efficiency of the close process. Third, several \{SEC\} filings have contained control weaknesses related to the financial close process. Finally, academic research suggests that the time needed to complete the financial close process may serve as a proxy for a company's internal information environment quality. We draw upon prior research and conduct a field investigation with corporate financial officers from 22 different organizations to examine the role of four factors – need to meet expectations, collaboration among multiple participants, estimation process, and ability to incorporate new regulations – in the financial close process. Results suggest that researchers should examine further how the need to meet (or beat) expectations impacts management's actions and the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. Future work could also explore how hidden profile task research and technology advances may improve the financial close process. Finally, research needs to examine how ex post estimate analysis may improve not only estimate quality but also the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial close process. "

The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of media and content types on stakeholders' engagement on Western European local governments' Facebook pages. The sample includes 15-member countries of the \{EU\} via 75 local governments belonging to four different public administration styles, analyzing 50 posts from each municipality. The posts were coded into 16 content types (e.g. environment, housing) and 5 media types (e.g. video, text), respectively. Metrics of popularity, commitment, virality and engagement were also computed for each post. Results show that the most used media types are links and photos. Cultural activities, sports and marketing related topics are the most widely posted by Western European local governments, but these contents do not seem to be the most relevant for citizens. Local governments' preferences to different media and content types seem to depend on the institutional context. Significant differences on engagement levels by citizens have also been found among media and content types and in different institutional contexts. This study provides practitioners and academics with some initial research findings about the effect of different communicational strategies on citizen engagement, which are very important factors in order to improve the effectiveness of e-participation offerings.

The impact sourcing model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus has led to the ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce research about how impact sourcing companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact sourcing companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of impact sourcing companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It also emphasizes the role of ‘social’ encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which impact sourcing companies are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities. "

The objective of this paper is to make the case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2. critically that data consists of meta-data—data entered independently of the actions of auditee—and not just data entered by the auditee; 3. process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing practice become feasible. "

The accounting literature indicates that the presentation of financial information either within the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements often creates functional fixation where users of financial statements fail to adjust for differences in accounting policy. This leads users to judge what would otherwise be identical financial situations as being different due to the different accounting policies and methods adopted. It has been suggested that the use of digital formats in presenting financial reports may overcome functional fixation. Using an experimental design involving accountants in public practice, the results indicate that the use of digital formats to present financial reports does not fully overcome the issue of functional fixation in the processing of financial information. Although the participants were able to identify and extract relevant information, irrespective of whether or not the information was presented within the financial statements or in the notes to the accounts, the evidence indicates that functional fixation remained when the participants made final decisions based on available information. This suggests that functional fixation may not be caused by access to or extraction of information but by the level of perceived significance based on where the information is reported in the financial statements. In general, the results indicate that current technology may not be able to fully reduce functional fixation in the evaluation of financial information prepared in accordance with different accounting policies and methods.

The new generation of information provision has been dubbed by Chairman Cox, ‘interactive data’ (SEC, 2006a). Despite the promise of its name, we find that in the development of the project retail investors are invoked as calculative actors rather than engaged in dialogue. Similarly, the potential for the underlying technology to be applied in ways to encourage new forms of accountability appears to be forfeited in the interests of enrolling company filers. We theorise the activities of the \{SEC\} and in particular its chairman at the time, Christopher Cox, over a three year period, both prior to and following the ‘credit crisis’. We argue that individuals and institutions play a central role in advancing the socio-technical project that is constituted by interactive data. We adopt insights from \{ANT\} (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 2005b) and governmentality (Miller, 2008; Miller and Rose, 2008) to show how regulators and the proponents of the technology have acted as spokespersons for the interactive data technology and the retail investor. We examine the way in which calculative accountability has been privileged in the SEC's construction of the retail investor as concerned with atomised, quantitative data (Kamuf, 2007; Roberts, 2009; Tsoukas, 1997). We find that the possibilities for the democratising effects of digital information on the Internet has not been realised in the interactive data project and that it contains risks for the very investors the \{SEC\} claims to seek to protect.

It discusses their implications for enterprise information management (EIM). It is not a comprehensive discussion of \{EIM\} requirements and methodology but rather a discussion of \{EIM\} from a business perspective and a focus on the aspects of \{EIM\} that require particular attention in a service-oriented, agile enterprise. Information is the lifeblood of the enterprise. Without information there can be no coordinated activity, no record of accomplishments, no plans for the future. Management of information is a critical responsibility and becomes increasingly critical as enterprises become international and require greater agility. \{EIM\} involves the validation, transformation, storage, communication, and presentation of data to provide information to support the pursuit of enterprise objectives. Data are the raw materials typically managed by computers; information is the organized presentation of data in context that has business meaning to humans. "

We develop a survey tool and ask \{IT\} and financial accounting practitioners to assess the impact of these items on \{IT\} audit quality.

An \{IPS2\} includes integratively developed product and service modules. The integrative character challenges the \{IPS2\} development by steering interactions between people from different disciplines (product and service) within the provider's company. Further, the provision of \{IPS2\} requires various competences. Consequently, the \{IPS2\} provider needs cooperation partners in order to fill competence gaps and to concentrate on own core competencies. This kind of interaction has also to be steered target-oriented. Further, the long duration of \{IPS2\} business relationships and incomplete information about future changes cause uncertainty in the decision making along the \{IPS2\} lifecycle. An innovative method for steering interactions and dealing with uncertainty is the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The goal of the \{ICS\} is the early detection and target-oriented development of intangible innovation and success potentials. It goes beyond the traditional financial balance sheet and focuses on three kinds of capital, namely human capital, structural capital and relational capital. As the \{ICS\} focuses on intangibles, its application to the \{IPS2\} context appears reasonable. The main difference by using \{ICS\} for \{IPS2\} is that this method is dimensioned for companies as well as single departments. The challenge is to transfer the \{ICS\} from the system boundary of one firm to an \{IPS2\} and therefore to a network of companies. This paper gives answers to the questions why an \{ICS\} is necessary in the context of \{IPS2\} and what adjustments are required in order to adapt \{ICS\} for IPS2. "

Drawing on the analytical model by Hemmer and Labro (2008), in which the forward-looking perspective of \{FA\} leads to forward-looking MA, we build a conceptual framing to analyze this convergence. According to this framing, information technology (IT) serves as a facilitator, catalyst, motivator, or even an enabler for the convergence of \{MA\} and FA. We further argue that convergence is a much broader phenomenon than claimed by Hemmer and Labro. It firstly covers the technical and technological domain, including the intentional integration of information systems and software, as well as the intentional combination of methods or standards, extending thereafter to the behavioral and organizational domain with the (un)intentional alignment regarding both functions and processes as well as the (un)intentional convergence regarding both work and roles. The applicability of this conceptual framing is illustrated with a set of examples. We present illustrations of the manifestations and outcomes of convergence in both the technical and technological domain (related to accounting standards, discretionary reporting, performance measurement, transfer pricing, competitor, customer and contractor analysis, due diligence in M&amp;As), and the behavioral and organizational manifestation domain (related to accounting processes, work and the role of accountants, incentive systems, accounting and control in multinational companies, the control of business networks, the board of directors and venture capitalists). Based on our observations, we conclude that the forward-looking \{FA\} elements are often intertwined with MA, and vice versa, and that convergence in the technical and technological domain appears to precede convergence in the behavioral and organizational domain. In most of our observations, \{IT\} plays an important or even crucial role in this convergence process. In the light of these convergence observations, we open several avenues for further research.

If they are published free of license fees, they are known as open standards. For a straight through processing (STP) environment, three types of standards are relevant that include business standards, technology standards, and financial ontologies. This chapter focuses on financial technology standards relevant to creating an \{STP\} environment. It introduces financial technology protocols and discusses the value of using industry standards for electronic communication of trade data. Currently, three industry standards, FIX, FpML, and SWIFT, are used for system communication of financial data in the securities industry. Firms build their own communication vocabularies for exchanging financial data, and in order to use industry standards, they must build translators that can convert the industry format and vocabulary to their legacy ones. An insight is provided into how firms contribute to, transform, and extend industry standards to meet their own needs. The move toward industry standards is crucial for achieving \{STP\} in the trade lifecycle, and more and more firms are adopting one of these ontologies for interfirm communication. However, concern remains over which format to use for high-speed high-volume trade and market data, and firms struggle to translate industry standards to their internal legacy data formats. "

In traditional approaches, identification of an organization’s \{IC\} is usually done manually through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc. These methods are labor and time intensive and the quality of the results is highly dependent on, among other things, the experience of the investigators. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Intellectual Capital Extraction (KBICE) algorithm which incorporates the technologies of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic processing of unstructured data and extraction of important IC-related information. The performance of \{KBICE\} was assessed through a series of experiments conducted by using publicly available financial reports from the banking industry as the testing batch and encouraging results have been obtained. The results showed that, through the use of hybrid intelligent matching strategies, it is possible to extract commonly referred IC-related information from unstructured data automatically. \{IC\} information analyst can rely on this method as an additional mean to identify and extract the commonly sought \{IC\} information from financial reports in a fast, systematic and reliable manner.

To develop structure to research in data mining, we create a taxonomy that combines research on patterns of observed fraud schemes with an appreciation of areas that benefit from productive application of data mining. We encapsulate traditional views of data mining that operates primarily on quantitative data, such as financial statement and journal entry data. In addition, we draw on other forms of data mining, notably text and email mining. "

This paper proposes that an individual's level of digital literacy affects her performance through its impact on her performance and effort expectations. To explain the influence of digital literacy on the intention of individuals to continue using e-learning and their performance, we integrate the concept of digital literacy with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and test our model using survey data from New Zealand accountants working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results indicate that these relationships were significant: digital literacy on users' performance and effort expectations, performance expectations on users' intentions to continue using Web 2.0 tools, and continuance intention on performance. These findings suggest that individual digital literacy facilitates the use of e-learning, and should be considered when examining the impact of the latter on performance. "

This situation has been recognized as contributing to financial market risks and limiting the potential of smart disclosure policies to benefit financial market stakeholders. This paper adapts an existing framework for information sharing and integration to the complex environment of financial market regulation (FMR) to present an argument for the criticality of effective cross-boundary information sharing to financial regulators seeking to establish robust governance of financial markets. The framework is then used to outline the challenges to information sharing and integration in \{FMR\} and to help model the related information flows. Current literature and a recent study of information sharing in \{FMR\} are used to identify key actors in \{FMR\} information sharing relationships to outline the challenges faced in this unique context and the resulting risk if these challenges go unaddressed.

Given the increasing popularity of \{IDV\} as a tool for making sense of complex data, it is important that accountants become familiar with and learn how to use this technology. This case provides a hands-on opportunity to organize complex accounting data to create \{IDVs\} for decision makers to use. Further, the case enables students to understand the potential impact of \{IDVs\} on preparers and users of accounting information. Students will assume the role of a division controller in a hypothetical company and create an \{IDV\} to assist the chief executive officer (CEO) in decision making. "

Study analyses focused on end user perceptions of \{ERP\} component usefulness, their intention to use the system, and self-reported usage of a system component. Valuable insights into the perceptions of professional end users toward a component of a complex technology were gained. Recommendations based upon the results of this study include: (a) clearly describe, early in the implementation process, an overall picture of the \{ERP\} system flow and visually show end users how the components they use “fit” into the whole system; (b) convert ERP-related “tech talk” to common end user language by either clear explanation of unique terms or associations of new terms to ones commonly understood by end users, and (c) provide adequate resources (financial, physical, human, etc.) to ensure that end users have access to timely support.

Extending previous studies on Web-based disclosure, a checklist of 40 items is developed to evaluate the level of Internet-based voluntary disclosure. Measuring information asymmetry by the spread and the probability of informed trading, we show that greater Web-based disclosure lowers information asymmetry in the French financial market. "

In essence, the Delphi method has potential to provide both rigor and relevance to \{AIS\} researchers. Our purpose is to review the prior literature on the use of the Delphi method and discuss potential areas of research within the \{AIS\} discipline where the method might add value. Based on this review, we develop a series of guidelines on how to properly develop, administer, and assess panel responses and then use an illustrative study example that explores \{IT\} risks in operations.

We describe an architecture and an interaction scenario and implement a prototype. We propose a number of evaluation metrics for measuring the viability of different terms for the purpose of comparing concepts. In scripted experiments, orderings for candidate terms from the prototype are compared to gold standard ranking lists from structured external sources.

The original purpose of financial instruments was to act as transfer channels for funds between investors and businesses. The purpose of financial instruments has expanded from funding to risk diversification. Although certain derivatives and insurance contracts have been around for centuries, the increased volatility in the financial system introduced in the 1970s set in motion an explosion of product development. Financial instruments used to exist to move money through time backward and forward. Although the occasional crash still instills some modesty into the best of financial engineers, instruments can be tailored to client profiles and to an investor's needs and objectives and current portfolio. Many types of exposure can now be priced and traded, and products can often be tailor-made against an investor's portfolios and desired exposure. A useful categorization of financial instruments, both in terms of processing as well as for risk measurement, is looking at the cash flows. "

Individual differences in the cognitive ability of decision makers to use information can lead to systematic differences in judgments. We identify and label one of these individual cognitive differences comprehensive thinking ability: the ability to think about multiple paths, branches or alternatives. Significant comprehensive thinking ability is likely to mitigate systematic differences in judgment in many contexts. We report the results of a series of studies using a variation on the investment trap (sunk cost or irrelevant cost) problem and a probability revision task. The findings suggest that comprehensive thinking ability may also explain other common systematic differences in judgment. "

We argue that the marketing language surrounding the AICPA's “Vision Project” prior to Enron (1997–2001) is not durably supplanted by the language of parrhesia, celebrated during the Enron crisis management episode (2002–2004) – it reemerges after 2005, juxtaposed to parrhesia. This study contributes to increasing our understanding of the institutional complexity of the accounting professional field by suggesting that this complexity is, in part, cultivated and reproduced by \{AICPA\} leaders’ navigation between different conceptions of being an accountant. Institutional complexity can thus be viewed as a resource, rather than a constraint, which provides flexible impression management opportunities. "

To gain insight into the state of affairs, we surveyed 210 internal auditors worldwide on the status of their use of continuous auditing. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) we explore the antecedents of internal auditors' intentions to use continuous auditing technology. Employing the Partial Least Squares method, we find strong support for the model with an \{R2\} of 44.3%. Specifically, we find that internal auditors' perceptions of effort expectancy and social influence are significant predictors of their intentions to use continuous auditing. We also find that annual sales volume of the company and voluntariness of use significantly moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and social influence respectively. Additionally, we find regional differences in the significance of key \{UTAUT\} antecedents. Specifically, we find that the North American internal auditors are more likely to use continuous auditing due to soft social coercion pressures of Social Influence through peers and higher authorities. On the other hand, Middle Eastern auditors are more likely to use the technology if it is mandated by the higher authorities. "

The various states and professional organizations are attempting to mitigate investment risks with regulations and methodology instructions, and, thus inspiring new confidence, to kick-start financing, which is the engine driving the real estate market. New methods and approaches are necessary in the area of real estate appraisal also, to ensure that the market value of works in progress could be accurately determined at all times, thereby facilitating the management of risks and reinforcing the confidence of the investors. The author of the article reviews and evaluates the methods with which the value of works in progress can be estimated well, and which can replace the static, simplistic approach currently used by appraisers. While comparative methodology is not suitable to tackle the problem, as the first practical step, in the net replacement cost based valuation approach the Market Value of the land, as value-forming factor, must continuously be examined. The income-based calculation approach can easily be made suitable for the determination of the Market Value of works in progress. "

Accounting Information Systems (AIS) researchers interested in capturing affect within such contexts ought to consider methods that are designed to capture affect close to its realization. One such approach is the experience sampling method (ESM), developed as a way to collect individuals' subjective perceptions of their cognitions, motivations and affect as they become manifest. In short, \{ESM\} involves capturing brief responses from individuals throughout the day over the course of weeks or even months. By doing so, researchers can strengthen internal validity weaknesses associated with surveys and interviews, and increase ecological validity beyond laboratory experiments. \{ESM\} data is rich with possibilities for within- and between-participant comparisons. However, conducting an \{ESM\} study is much more intense and time-consuming than a one-time survey. In this paper, we discuss the concept of ESM, explain how and it can be used for studying affect, explore various theoretical considerations, and mention some key implementation issues. Our objective is to highlight the \{ESM\} and offer directions for \{AIS\} researchers interested in evaluating the suitability of the \{ESM\} method for their research programs. "

A series of nominal group processes involving information technology auditors, \{ITA\} managers, and financial auditors from three different internal audit organizations was performed to generate source data. This data was then coded and analyzed using a constant comparison approach to identify the codes, indicators, concepts, and relationships included in the theory. The results reveal 26 concepts organized into six categories: Audit Organization, Client Organization, Enterprise Environment, Process and Methodology, Target Process or System, and Audit Personnel. Based on the data and the concepts identified ten propositions are suggested. The results are then compared with prior research. "

The Program, which has grown and evolved over the past 20 years, was founded on the purported benefits of experiential learning and calls dating back nearly three decades for curricular change designed to enhance the core competencies of accounting graduates. The internship is organized and run as an actual accounting practice in which the instructor serves as the Executive Partner and maintains professional liability insurance though the \{AICPA\} carrier. Students, working in teams ranging in size from three to seven, serve as the professional staff. The client base consists of not-for-profit organizations that vary in size and complexity. Services range from limited scope consulting engagements to operational and financial audits. As evidence of program quality, in 2011 the practice successfully completed an \{AICPA\} mandatory peer review for quality of accounting, auditing and attestation services performed by \{AICPA\} members in public practice. Additional assessment data in the form of student and employer feedback indicate that the Program is meeting its stated objectives. The description of program operations, cost and fee structure, and implementation recommendations presented in this paper may be used as a guide for those faculty interested in implementing similar programs at their institutions.

A total of 451 individuals participated in an experiment. The partial least squares technique was applied to data collected via a questionnaire to test the proposed model. The results indicate that online purchase intention depends on perceived value and trust. The main predictors of perceived trust are perceived information quality and perceived security. Consumers' perceived security depends on vendor reputation, website investment, third-party assurance seals, understanding of third-party seals, privacy and security policies, familiarity with the website, Internet privacy concerns, and disposition towards third-party certification.
