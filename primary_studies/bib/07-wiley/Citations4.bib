abstract = {This chapter discusses the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) disclosures and provides a review of related checklists. Disclosures are a very important part of IFRS. The type and volume of disclosures varies significantly between the standards. However, nearly all standards have a section on disclosure. Some standards, such as International Accounting Standards 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, as the name of that standard suggests, provide guidance on presentation of financial reports. The matter of disclosures is complex and, potentially, is a confounding one. Therefore it is no surprise that major accounting service firms have issued checklists to manage information to do with disclosures. Effectively, disclosure checklists are a tool for auditors and were developed, originally, to make sure that auditors did not miss anything when conducting audits. In addition, such checklists are valuable when used as evidence, such as in potential law suits, to show that auditors have done the work.},

abstract = {Sustainability is not a passing fad, although the finance function as a whole often remains skeptical of sustainability efforts and reporting. This article argues that Finance should become an involved participant—and even a leader—in sustainability efforts. It shows how the finance function can add value to these efforts and why this help is crucial. It then introduces a maturity model against which the finance function can assess its status in supporting and leading sustainability initiatives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {With the spreading of XML sources, mining XML data can be an important objective in the near future. This paper presents a project focussed on designing a general-purpose query language in support of mining XML data. In our framework, raw data, mining models and domain knowledge are represented by way of XML documents and stored inside native XML databases. Data mining (DM) tasks are expressed in an extension of XQuery. Special attention is given to the frequent pattern discovery problem, and a way of exploiting domain-dependent optimizations and efficient data structures as deeper as possible in the extraction process is presented. We report the results of a first bunch of experiments, showing that a good trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency in XML DM is not a chimera. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
