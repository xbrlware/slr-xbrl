abstract = {Sustainability information is needed at both the macro and micro levels, it will require a multi-level approach that provides information and metrics that can drive high-level strategic corporate/regional sustainability plans, to low-level actions such as improving the energy efficiency of an office worker. This chapter provides an overview of multi-level sustainable information, and introduces the wider context of sustainability frameworks, principles, and tools. The information requirements of Green and Sustainable practices are examined at multiple levels including organisation (regional sustainability plan, greenhouse gases emission reporting), business function (data centre energy efficiency), product/service (life cycle assessment), and individual (commute tracking). The chapter also examines how the sustainability capability of an organisation can be examined to determine its effectiveness.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the partnership of Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBLR) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and reflects upon achievements to date. The chapter introduces the integral taxonomy, the matter of IFRS translation, and provides a list of support materials, including a glossary of XBRL-related terminology. Through its Foundation, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was involved in building taxonomy to drive global adoption of both IFRS and XBRL. This powerful combination caters to people who understand accounting standards and concepts on one side and people who use technology tools to segment and organize financial and business information. XBRL partners perfectly with IFRS in delivering better and faster business reporting. Significant initiatives continue to move this union into the global domain so as to maximise the benefits arising from increased acceptance and implementation of both standards. Future steps are considered in the chapter in relation to XBRL and the acceptance of this standard by prospective users.},

We propose defining readability as the effective communication of valuation-relevant information. The Fog Index—the most commonly applied readability measure—is shown to be poorly specified in financial applications. Of Fog's two components, one is misspecified and the other is difficult to measure. We report that 10-K document file size provides a simple readability proxy that outperforms the Fog Index, does not require document parsing, facilitates replication, and is correlated with alternative readability constructs.},

abstract = {Using a novel data set that tracks all web traffic on the SEC's EDGAR servers from 2008 to 2011, we examine the determinants and capital market consequences of investor information acquisition of SEC filings. The average user employs the database very few times per quarter and most users target specific filing types such as periodic accounting reports; a small subset of users employ EDGAR almost daily and access many filings. EDGAR activity is positively related with corporate events (particularly restatements, earnings announcements, and acquisition announcements), poor stock performance, and the strength of a firm's information environment. EDGAR activity is related to, but distinct from, other proxies of investor interest such as trading volume, business press articles, and Google searches. Finally, information acquisition via EDGAR, both to obtain earnings news and to provide context for it, has a positive influence on market efficiency with respect to earnings news. Overall, our results are important because they provide a unique, user-based perspective on investor access of mandatory disclosures and its impact on price formation.},

abstract = {This study proposes a knowledge management framework for developing and managing enterprise resource planning (ERP) curriculum within business schools. Both theory and a practical implementation are addressed. The knowledge management (KM)1 framework has two components which utilize ERP from a big picture curriculum overview and a ground level coursework perspective. First, a flowchart illustrates the mapping of ERP2 system practice cases to program courses. Using the flowchart, faculty can more easily communicate and manage ERP curriculum features within an existing major course structure. Our design was implemented using a specific ERP system and example company setup to provide for minimal start-up and overhead costs for faculty and a minimal learning curve for students. The second component of the KM framework provides a mapping and library function. Specific design course cells have a general description of case summary features and/or homework exercises. Each design course cell also links to the relevant ERP system settings and a list of learning objectives. This mapping enables one company to be used throughout an undergraduate Accounting or IS degree program where the student's learning experiences in each course are tailored to provide by program's end a broad experiential view of ERP system usage. The system design flowchart is flexible and can be modified year-to-year or differentiated to work at any school. The system design flowchart also enables faculty to assign a list of accreditation competencies (within the context of learning objectives) to each course in the system design chart.},

These bodies are positioning themselves as leading on climate change, for example, through launching professional training courses, funding research, and initiating corporate workshops and seminars. The paper examines the role of the accountancy profession in governing the new carbon economy. We review climate change related activities undertaken by accountancy professional bodies through drawing on primary empirical material, including interviews with accountants, accountancy standard setters and professional bodies. A mix of theories about the role of calculation, measurement and expertise in governance are used to help explain and understand the situation, including ideas about accountancy and society, epistemic communities, and governmentality.},

Operational Risk, which can be defined briefly as the risk generated by possible failures of a entity's Information Systems (IS), must be measured, covered, mitigated and managed by applying a series of methodologies, each of which assumes that the IS of the bank operates at a certain Stage of Sophistication. The present study proposes a scheme of evolution that details the stages of enhancement in the sophistication of their IS that banking entities may implement, so as to be capable of capturing, mitigating and managing Operational Risk. Using econometric methods, we create a proxy variable to capture the IS Sophistication of each entity. Then, the factor of entity size has been analyzed, and the country effect is explored. Additionally, the importance of intangible assets is weighted, among others entity aspects. The entity size has been revealed as the variable with most influence on the plans formulated in this respect by European entities, against other variables also considered in the present study, such as the country effect or the importance of intangible assets. The work shows how IS decisions referring to Operational Risk management are very influenced by size. It could introduce competition differences in the European banking system.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on some of the ethical issues related to voluntary disclosure of qualitative information by Canadian public companies. Drawing on various organizational theories, we examine some of the ways that companies can symbolically manage legitimacy through disclosure. Press releases of a sample of companies that received cease-trading orders were analysed for their use of language. We found that high-risk companies attempted to manage legitimacy by selectively releasing information and by using ambiguous language. Moreover, some companies behaved unethically by using language that suggested a positive future despite the imminent release of a cease-trading order. These findings have implications for organizational and accounting theorists and stakeholders in the corporate, fiduciary, and investment communities. Copyright © 2008 ASAC.

As adoption of innovations and CSR commitment are linked with firm size and national culture/legislation, we hypothesize that size and national culture/legislation, may have an effect on WA level. The authors studied an international sample made up of companies included in EUROSTOXX600 (The STOXX Europe 600 Index). The main results suggest that both size and culture have a significant effect on WA. Large firms as well as Anglo-Saxon companies are more prone to have higher WA levels. A deeper analysis, which was done through the estimation of quantile regression equations, showed that the influence of size is significant for companies trying to excel or for those trying to avoid the worst WA. However, the effect of size is significant only in the lowest part of the conditional distribution.},
