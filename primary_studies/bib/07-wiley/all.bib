abstract = {Sustainability information is needed at both the macro and micro levels, it will require a multi-level approach that provides information and metrics that can drive high-level strategic corporate/regional sustainability plans, to low-level actions such as improving the energy efficiency of an office worker. This chapter provides an overview of multi-level sustainable information, and introduces the wider context of sustainability frameworks, principles, and tools. The information requirements of Green and Sustainable practices are examined at multiple levels including organisation (regional sustainability plan, greenhouse gases emission reporting), business function (data centre energy efficiency), product/service (life cycle assessment), and individual (commute tracking). The chapter also examines how the sustainability capability of an organisation can be examined to determine its effectiveness.},

The chapter introduces the integral taxonomy, the matter of IFRS translation, and provides a list of support materials, including a glossary of XBRL-related terminology. Through its Foundation, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was involved in building taxonomy to drive global adoption of both IFRS and XBRL. This powerful combination caters to people who understand accounting standards and concepts on one side and people who use technology tools to segment and organize financial and business information. XBRL partners perfectly with IFRS in delivering better and faster business reporting. Significant initiatives continue to move this union into the global domain so as to maximise the benefits arising from increased acceptance and implementation of both standards. Future steps are considered in the chapter in relation to XBRL and the acceptance of this standard by prospective users.},

Of Fog's two components, one is misspecified and the other is difficult to measure. We report that 10-K document file size provides a simple readability proxy that outperforms the Fog Index, does not require document parsing, facilitates replication, and is correlated with alternative readability constructs.},

abstract = {Using a novel data set that tracks all web traffic on the SEC's EDGAR servers from 2008 to 2011, we examine the determinants and capital market consequences of investor information acquisition of SEC filings. The average user employs the database very few times per quarter and most users target specific filing types such as periodic accounting reports; a small subset of users employ EDGAR almost daily and access many filings. EDGAR activity is positively related with corporate events (particularly restatements, earnings announcements, and acquisition announcements), poor stock performance, and the strength of a firm's information environment. EDGAR activity is related to, but distinct from, other proxies of investor interest such as trading volume, business press articles, and Google searches. Finally, information acquisition via EDGAR, both to obtain earnings news and to provide context for it, has a positive influence on market efficiency with respect to earnings news. Overall, our results are important because they provide a unique, user-based perspective on investor access of mandatory disclosures and its impact on price formation.},

Both theory and a practical implementation are addressed. The knowledge management (KM)1 framework has two components which utilize ERP from a big picture curriculum overview and a ground level coursework perspective. First, a flowchart illustrates the mapping of ERP2 system practice cases to program courses. Using the flowchart, faculty can more easily communicate and manage ERP curriculum features within an existing major course structure. Our design was implemented using a specific ERP system and example company setup to provide for minimal start-up and overhead costs for faculty and a minimal learning curve for students. The second component of the KM framework provides a mapping and library function. Specific design course cells have a general description of case summary features and/or homework exercises. Each design course cell also links to the relevant ERP system settings and a list of learning objectives. This mapping enables one company to be used throughout an undergraduate Accounting or IS degree program where the student's learning experiences in each course are tailored to provide by program's end a broad experiential view of ERP system usage. The system design flowchart is flexible and can be modified year-to-year or differentiated to work at any school. The system design flowchart also enables faculty to assign a list of accreditation competencies (within the context of learning objectives) to each course in the system design chart.},

These bodies are positioning themselves as leading on climate change, for example, through launching professional training courses, funding research, and initiating corporate workshops and seminars. The paper examines the role of the accountancy profession in governing the new carbon economy. We review climate change related activities undertaken by accountancy professional bodies through drawing on primary empirical material, including interviews with accountants, accountancy standard setters and professional bodies. A mix of theories about the role of calculation, measurement and expertise in governance are used to help explain and understand the situation, including ideas about accountancy and society, epistemic communities, and governmentality.},

Operational Risk, which can be defined briefly as the risk generated by possible failures of a entity's Information Systems (IS), must be measured, covered, mitigated and managed by applying a series of methodologies, each of which assumes that the IS of the bank operates at a certain Stage of Sophistication. The present study proposes a scheme of evolution that details the stages of enhancement in the sophistication of their IS that banking entities may implement, so as to be capable of capturing, mitigating and managing Operational Risk. Using econometric methods, we create a proxy variable to capture the IS Sophistication of each entity. Then, the factor of entity size has been analyzed, and the country effect is explored. Additionally, the importance of intangible assets is weighted, among others entity aspects. The entity size has been revealed as the variable with most influence on the plans formulated in this respect by European entities, against other variables also considered in the present study, such as the country effect or the importance of intangible assets. The work shows how IS decisions referring to Operational Risk management are very influenced by size. It could introduce competition differences in the European banking system.},

Drawing on various organizational theories, we examine some of the ways that companies can symbolically manage legitimacy through disclosure. Press releases of a sample of companies that received cease-trading orders were analysed for their use of language. We found that high-risk companies attempted to manage legitimacy by selectively releasing information and by using ambiguous language. Moreover, some companies behaved unethically by using language that suggested a positive future despite the imminent release of a cease-trading order. These findings have implications for organizational and accounting theorists and stakeholders in the corporate, fiduciary, and investment communities. Copyright © 2008 ASAC.

The authors studied an international sample made up of companies included in EUROSTOXX600 (The STOXX Europe 600 Index). The main results suggest that both size and culture have a significant effect on WA. Large firms as well as Anglo-Saxon companies are more prone to have higher WA levels. A deeper analysis, which was done through the estimation of quantile regression equations, showed that the influence of size is significant for companies trying to excel or for those trying to avoid the worst WA. However, the effect of size is significant only in the lowest part of the conditional distribution.},

We studied a database made up of 51 European banks whose shares are included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX® TMI Banks [8300] Index. Regarding the factors for the implementation of WA, we considered two feasible reasons. First, WA adoption can be motivated by operational factors, as WA can contribute to increase the efficiency of the operations. Second, WA can also be understood as a part of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy, so banks that are more committed with CSR should be more prone to implement WA. However, our results indicate that neither operational nor social factors seem to have exerted a significant influence on WA adoption. An implication of these findings is the advisability of orientating governmental policies to firm awareness of the fact that WA should be a part of the CSR activities of banks. Regarding the effects of the implementation of WA, our results indicate that the effort pays dividends in terms of Internet visibility. This could eventually contribute to increase future revenues and, therefore, the performance of WA-committed banks.},

Confidentiality, however, may be at risk when combined with other sources. Public sector information not only describes government activity but contains material, such as campaign finance filings, produced by outside sources. How does information production impact policy concerns if material is reused for big data projects? Information production is analyzed using a framework of five methods of production. The framework considers information that the public sector writes, publishes, manages, produces through research, and compiles through legal mandates. This paper examines the policy implications of using U.S. federal public sector information in big data projects.},

abstract = {Message layer security is necessary to ensure the end-to-end security of Web services. To provide confidentiality against the intermediaries along the message path, XML encryption is used to partially encrypt the message. Because the data structure is changed by the partial encryption, the encrypted message is no longer valid with respect to the original schema definition. Thus, problems occur regarding the processing of the schema validation and the data binding by the intermediary. In this paper, we discuss two possible methods to solve these problems. The first method is to transform the original schema definition. The second is to transform the received message. We examined these methods by applying them to demonstration experiment of Web services. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The markets are developed by a GARCH model based on the S&P 500. These simulated markets are grouped by a main parameter: high volatility, bearish trend, bullish trend and low volatility. The inputs retained of the SVM are traditional technical trading rules used in quantitative analysis, such as relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) decision rules. The outputs of the SVM are the degree of set membership and market movement (bullish or bearish). The design of the SVM algorithm has been developed by Matlab and SVM-KM. The configuration for the SVM shows that the best results are achieved in simulated markets with high volatility; also results are good in trend simulated markets.

In this article, the Chief Innovation Officer of CDP discusses five ways that such disclosure is expected to lead to changes in corporate behavior.The first two are “internal” mechanisms that tend to encourage constructive change more or less directly as a result of going through the process of disclosure. One is known as “WGMGM,” which is shorthand for the often-cited principle that “what gets measured gets managed.” The second is the tendency of disclosure to bring about valuable changes in strategic thinking.The next two are mechanisms that work to effect change through “external” channels. One relies on the use of data to enable investors, regulators, and other corporate stakeholders to draw comparisons among companies and industries in assessing the value implications of climate change disclosure. The second involves competitor benchmarking and the growing use of data in investment research.Fifth and last, recent evidence suggests that a growing number of investors are willing to raise the bar in terms of the expectations they place on companies to act responsibly now in the face of current and expected future changes.Each of these five change processes are discussed while citing evidence drawn from CDP's long experience of managing the disclosure process and working with both investors and companies to convert data into action.},

The type and volume of disclosures varies significantly between the standards. However, nearly all standards have a section on disclosure. Some standards, such as International Accounting Standards 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, as the name of that standard suggests, provide guidance on presentation of financial reports. The matter of disclosures is complex and, potentially, is a confounding one. Therefore it is no surprise that major accounting service firms have issued checklists to manage information to do with disclosures. Effectively, disclosure checklists are a tool for auditors and were developed, originally, to make sure that auditors did not miss anything when conducting audits. In addition, such checklists are valuable when used as evidence, such as in potential law suits, to show that auditors have done the work.},

Data mining (DM) tasks are expressed in an extension of XQuery. Special attention is given to the frequent pattern discovery problem, and a way of exploiting domain-dependent optimizations and efficient data structures as deeper as possible in the extraction process is presented.

abstract = {The benefits of using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) as a business reporting standard have been widely canvassed in the extant literature, in particular, as the enabling technology for standard business reporting tools. One of the key benefits noted is the ability of standard business reporting to create significant efficiencies in the regulatory reporting process. Efficiency-driven cost reductions are highly desirable by data and report producers. However, they may not have the same potential to create long-term firm value as improved effectiveness of decision making. This study assesses the perceptions of Australian business stakeholders in relation to the benefits of the Australian standard business reporting instantiation (SBR) for financial reporting. These perceptions were drawn from interviews of persons knowledgeable in XBRL-based standard business reporting and submissions to Treasury relative to SBR reporting options. The combination of interviews and submissions permit insights into the views of various groups of stakeholders in relation to the potential benefits. In line with predictions based on a transaction-cost economics perspective, interviewees who primarily came from a data and report-producer background mentioned benefits that centre largely on asset specificity and efficiency. The interviewees who principally came from a data and report-consumer background mentioned benefits that centre on reducing decision-making uncertainty and decision-making effectiveness. The data and report consumers also took a broader view of the benefits of SBR to the financial reporting supply chain. Our research suggests that advocates of SBR have successfully promoted its efficiency benefits to potential users. However, the effectiveness benefits of SBR, for example, the decision-making benefits offered to investors via standardised reports, while becoming more broadly acknowledged, remain not a priority for all stakeholders.},

It is a tool to bridge potential language barriers and unify financial reporting. This has appeal to foreign investors, among others, who can rely on information in XBRL-tagged financial reports to make investment decisions without having to translate financial statements from local language. In 2008, Israel required most public companies to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for financial reporting and to use XBRL-tagged reporting format, as part of an aggressive effort to make its capital markets more transparent and attractive for foreign investors. In this paper, we study all Israeli public companies and analyze the accuracy and reliability of their XBRL-tagged financial statements that are available on MAGNA, the Israel Securities Authority's electronic system. We describe the process by which the XBRL-based data were collected and reported. We document, categorize, and analyze deficiencies in the XBRL-tagged filings, and inconsistencies between them and the Hebrew-based annual reports. We observe pervasive data entry errors resulting in inaccurate XBRL-generated financial reports, which went undetected for over one year. Further, first year XBRL reporting (in conjunction with IFRS adoption) did not increase foreign investment in the Israeli capital markets. This analysis allows us to better understand the benefits and challenges of the adoption of XBRL.},

Our results indicate that the level of total accruals in the post-XBRL period is lower relative to the pre-XBRL period. This finding is robust to several controls for macroeconomic conditions and firm fundamentals. Moreover, we find this main effect is most prominent for firms that are most likely to benefit from greater transparency: high-growth firms, small firms, and firms in high-technology industries. One interpretation of our results is that XBRL implementation decreases investor’s information acquisition costs and thereby improves their ability to detect earnings management; managers in turn reduce accruals.},

The main finding is that data format made no difference to participants' ability to locate and integrate information from statement footnotes to improve investment decisions. Interactive data were perceived by participants as quick and ‘accurate’, but it failed to facilitate the identification of the adjustment needed to make the ratios accurate for comparison. An important implication is that regulators and software designers should work to reduce user reliance on the comparability of ratios generated automatically using interactive data.},

Worldwide, a large number of regulators are making an effort to promote the adoption of this standard to simplify and enhance the communication of financial information. This requires the definition of well-structured taxonomies that can standardize and accommodate the content of financial reports prepared by firms. This study aims to analyze the regulator-led adoption of XBRL for financial reporting. It examines the XBRL taxonomies used by Italian firms to reflect their financial reporting under rule-based Italian GAAP and principles-based International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). We compare the alignment of the Italian GAAP taxonomy and the IFRS taxonomy with Italian companies' financial statements and find two different levels of fit. The results offer useful insights for regulators and policy makers in prescribing or establishing appropriate taxonomies. We illustrate the potential impacts of the different taxonomies on the quality of financial reporting in terms of comparability and potential loss of information.},

abstract = {Availability of business data is an important aspect of effective financial activities. An easy access to financial information has immense influence on actions and decisions regarding investing, trade and operations of companies and firms. The proposed standard – eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) – provides a means to create a uniform framework for representing corporate and financial information. XBRL defines an easily interpretable, machine-readable and XML-based data format. Its flexibility allows for representing business data using different languages, as well as following different regulation standards.One of important benefits of XBRL is application of XML-based tools and systems that enable easy preparation, processing and validation of corporate data. It is also possible to use XML-based storage and query systems.In this paper we propose and describe a concept of soft queries. They provide the users with a human-friendly interface for interacting with XBRL data. These queries are equipped with linguistic terms (such as large, medium, small) and linguistic qualifiers (all, mostly). Such queries are able to provide the users with results similar to the results obtained when they analyse data themselves. Linguistic terms and qualifiers are represented as fuzzy sets. Fuzzy-based operations and aggregation operators allow for mimicking a human-like processing of data. The proposed approach is illustrated with queries executed on an XBRL document.

We then link the REA model to financial reporting using Microsoft Access. In addition, using the financial report in the database, students prepare and validate an eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) document for CIS.

The findings illustrate that the complexity of data consumption patterns drove increased interdependence within the financial information supply chain requiring the co-operative development of context sensitive data exchanges and commodity-like IT infrastructures. The paper concludes that the co-operative model to IOS development exhibited here is likely to be more suited to the development of systems for financial information supply chains than the hub and spoke model characteristic of IOS in other sectors.

This chapter examines those wider impacts, starting with impacts closely aligned to the accounting issues, namely impacts to do with systems, controls and internal audit. It considers the role of internal audit and of the audit committee. Both have important roles to play in helping to ensure that IFRS reporting becomes embedded in the organisation, and that assurance is obtained over the integrity of the IFRS reporting systems.},

The quality of SETU standard is ok compared to other electronic standards such as the US-GAAP XBRL standard in financial reporting. The study provides results to the SETU standards organization, in two ways: 1. the low quality of implementations raises the question what the SETU organization can do to improve the implementations; education, mandatory validation, or even certification might be solutions; 2. the analysis has been used for an improvement project within SETU. The analysis of element usage frequency and the two groups of frequent errors might lead to changes in new version of the standard.},

By using semi-structured interviews and a postal questionnaire survey, the perceptions of financial auditors and information technology (IT) audit practitioners were sought. The findings identify factors affecting, and pressures leading to, audit change in response to e-business as perceived by these auditors. Overall, the most obvious aspect of e-business audit change was felt to be the extensive use of IT-driven practices and techniques, and this change could not only be attributed to technical factors, but they also thought that competitive and professional factors were also important drivers of audit change.},

A key characteristic of CAS is a large, diverse, and sometimes unknown set of interactions both internally and across the system boundary. For the purpose of managing this complexity we present in this paper the concept that a principles orientation as compared to rules orientation of a complex system is an important and useful characteristic in need of further study.

None of the variation in score is explained by corporate revenue in the Asian and European firms in this sample (revenues greater than about $9 billion), but there is a very weak correlation between score and revenue for American firms of this size, and a stronger one when Fortune 1000 companies (all American) with revenues smaller than this are included, suggesting that, as corporate size reaches a certain threshold, sustainability reporting becomes independent of it.

The proposed integration methodology is a generalization of the merging model suggested in Fagini and Giudici (J. Oper. Res. Soc. 2010; in press) for a hierarchical data structure. In order to demonstrate the methodology, we use real data from a telecommunication company providing services to enterprises in different business lines and geographical locations. For each enterprise, we have collected information about operational and financial performance. The approach demonstrated in this case study can be generalized to general service providers who are concerned by both the quality of service and the financial solvency of their customers.
