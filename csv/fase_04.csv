A Case Study of Financial Statements Reporting System Based on XBRL Taxonomy in Accordance with Korean Public Institutions Adoption of K-IFRS;This study aims to propose a model to convert Public Institution Financial Reporting System (PIFRS) into a XBRL-based online in accordance with adopted Korean International FinancialHowever, the production of XBRL-based online PIFRS ensures the shortened period of preparation of closing statements and prompt response to the new establishment, change, integration, and discontinuance of public institutions, as well as the trustfulness of public financial information and the reduction of time in collecting related financial data. In addition, XBRL-based online PIFRS made it possible to reflect the change of account category by the revision of IFRS and respond to the frequent changes in account such as emission trading system, without the structural modification of the whole system but only with alignment of the Taxonomy. Therefore, it helped the system users consistently answer to the demand of the public announcement of various types of financial information and innovatively shortened the periods of financial reporting, submission and approval. Reporting Standards (K-IFRS). The financial reporting systems before the adaptation of PIFRS has found themselves with many input errors and time consumption in adding in the process of manual collection of Excel-based data and combining.;N
Accounting Information Systems: The Challenge of the Real-time Reporting;Real-time reporting in accounting or simply real-time accounting offers many benefits when compared to conventional periodic reporting. Traditionally, enterprises require financial or non-financial reporting based on quarterly and annual periods. Yet, the rapid change that occurs on market and society causes this periodic reporting to become quickly outdated. Higher competition among enterprises demands for more updated information to enable management to rapidly adapt to opportunities and answer problems. Real-time accounting addresses these needs, but needs new technological answers. In this article we present some technologies which can help the implementation of real-time accounting, namely, business process management, mobile devices, cloud computing, business intelligence, enterprise architecture and enterprise application integration.;S
An ontology modelling perspective on business reporting;"In this paper, we discuss the motivation and the fundamentals of an ontology representation of business reporting data and metadata structures as defined in the eXtensible business reporting language (XBRL) standard.

The core motivation for an ontology representation is the enhanced potential for integrated analytic applications that build on quantitative reporting data combined with structured and unstructured data from additional sources. Applications of this kind will enable significant enhancements in regulatory compliance management, as they enable business analytics combined with inference engines for statistical, but also for logical inferences.

In order to define a suitable ontology representation of business reporting language structures, an analysis of the logical principles of the reporting metadata taxonomies and further classification systems is presented. Based on this analysis, a representation of the generally accepted accounting principles taxonomies in XBRL by an ontology provided in the web ontology language (OWL) is proposed. An additional advantage of this representation is its compliance with the recent ontology definition metamodel (ODM) standard issued by OMG";N
A Semi-supervised Tool for Clustering Accounting Databases with Applications to Internal Controls;"A considerable body of literature attests to the significance of internal controls; however, little is known on how the clustering of accounting databases can function as an internal control procedure. To explore this issue further, this paper puts forward a semi-supervised tool that is based on self-organizing map and the IASB XBRL Taxonomy. The paper validates the proposed tool via a series of experiments on an accounting database provided by a shipping company. Empirical results suggest the tool can cluster accounting databases in homogeneous and well-separated clusters that can be interpreted within an accounting context. Further investigations reveal that the tool can compress a large number of similar transactions, and also provide information comparable to that of financial statements. The findings demonstrate that the tool can be applied to verify the processing of accounting transactions as well as to assess the accuracy of financial statements, and thus supplement internal controls";S
BaselMapper: An experimental tool for managing Operational Risk in banks;The Basel Capital Agreement (Basel II) required all banking entities actively to manage Operational Risk by means of making explicit measurements and creating specific items in their general ledgers. Currently, the most sophisticated resource for handling transactional information is the XBRL-GL Taxonomy, an electronic dictionary of business elements or digital tags based on eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), the digital mark-up language for financial contexts, which in turn has the special feature of incorporating transactional or Global Ledger (GL) information. This study proposes, in one hand, an extension of that dictionary, to incorporate Operational Risk information, and in the other hand, a simple tool to edit and visualise such reports, called BaselMapper, which is tested with a business expert. Since this experimental tool, BaselMapper, was created in 2007 and validated in 2008, till the publication date of this article, several changes have occurred in both its normative and technical foundations. Due to the financial crisis, the Bank of International Settlements has developed a new set of reforms in banking regulation, beyond the Basel II agreement described here, called Basel III. To consult the current regulatory framework, please visit: http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm Operational Risk aspects were not modified. Additionally, a new version of the XBRLGL taxonomy is now available, called Global Ledger, at: http://www.xbrl.org/GLFiles/ that still incorporates the COR-BUS module used here. So, essentially, these changes do not modify the aim of this paper, which is to promote the use of XBRL-enabled technology for Operational Risk measurement in banking institutions at the international level. Further research will be necessary to maintain this tool properly updated, with the substantial participation of more potential users.;S

Comparing Internet Financial Reporting Practices: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and Australia;Internet financial reporting practices in Indonesia is one form of transparency and accountability of good corporate governance. Good corporate governance requires companies to present information timely, clear, and comparable, especially concerning financial issues, management and company ownership. The research objective is to compare the quality of corporate disclosure of internet financial reporting in Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia and Australia. The sample in this research is the companies in each country (Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and Australia) are the best in the category of Forbes magazine (Forbes 2000). Indonesia's best to use the criteria established by SWA magazine (SWA 100). The result of this study indicates that there are differences in IFR quality between companies in Malaysia with companies in Australia and Japan. This study also shows that there is a difference in IFR quality between companies in Indonesia with companies in Australia, Singapore and Japan.;N
Computer-Assisted Tools for Auditing XBRL-Related Documents;"Across the world, regulators and government

Corporate social responsibility and sustainability reporting on the Internet;All material related to environmental and social performance on the corporate internet sites of 454 Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies in 25 industrial sectors was analyzed using the Pacific Sustainability Index. Maximum scores for individual sectors were 20–75 percent of the total possible, highest in the largest and most environmentally sensitive sectors and ranging generally linearly, as shown by plotting score versus rank, down to nearly zero in every sector. None of the variation in score is explained by corporate revenue in the Asian and European firms in this sample (revenues greater than about $9 billion), but there is a very weak correlation between score and revenue for American firms of this size, and a stronger one when Fortune 1000 companies (all American) with revenues smaller than this are included, suggesting that, as corporate size reaches a certain threshold, sustainability reporting becomes independent of it.

\CSR\ reporting practices of Eurozone companies;"Abstract

For most of the world's largest companies, reporting on non-financial information appears to be a continuing trend.

Communication of social and environmental dimensions of the company plays a key role in the sustainable development of organizations, and therefore should be investigated more in depth.

The aim of this empirical study is to analyse the extent to which Eurozone companies report on CSR indicators, according to the Integrated Scorecard Taxonomy Scoreboard of the Spanish Accounting and Business Association (AECA), and the factors that can influence its use.

A content analysis was conducted on the annual sustainability reports on the websites of 306 Eurozone companies listed in the STOXX Europe 600.

The results revealed an intensive use of corporate governance indicators, a moderate disclosure of environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), and a low use of social indicators. Our study also showed that there is an influence of sector, and the listing in DJSI on the extent of sustainability reporting.";N
E-Business Conflict Resolution: The Role of XBRL, the Next-Generation Digital Language of Business Reporting;Conflict Resolution (an intervention aimed at alleviating or eliminating electronic discord through conciliation) as a business theme is more important than ever in todays fast paced world of e-business and globalization. The significance of an efficient financial reporting and the Internet in human lives cannot be understated. Investors and users of the Internet need accurate and reliable financial information that can be delivered promptly to help them make informed financial decisions. The Internet embodies the importance of technology, its role in resolving disputes, and its impact on the increasing globalization of business, information, and culture. XBRL means Extensible Business Reporting Language. It is an open specification which uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) based data tags to describe financial statements for both public and private companies. It uses accepted financial reporting standards and practices to exchange financial statements across all software and technologies, including the Internet. It is a twenty-first century digital business reporting language which allows software vendors, programmers, intermediaries in the information preparation and distribution process and end users who adopt it as a specification to enhance the creation, exchange, and comparison of business reporting information. This paper, using the secondary data methodology approach suitable for large expository research, presents the advent of the XBRL technology and framework, its history and why it is essential. It reveals the relationship between XBRL and emerging e-standards, highlights the XBRL as a vital support for e-business, and showcases the largest XBRL e-government project in the world. This research finds that XBRL streamlines the financial information supply chain that includes public and private companies, the accounting profession, data aggregators, the investment community and all other users of financial statements. Findings also show that XBRL offers several key benefits like technology independence, full interoperability, efficient preparation of financial statements and reliable extraction of financial information. This work recommends that organizations/investors in every industry, regulatory bodies, professional associations, government, and educational institutions must embrace the XBRL in order not to suffer obsolescence and uncompetitiveness.

Electronic data reporting (EDR), metadata, standards and the European statistical system (ESS);;N
Environmental reporting on the internet by America's Toxic 100: Legitimacy and self-presentation;We are living in a fast changing world, especially in the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) sector. In this difficult environment people like to use buzzwords and acronyms -- in the title of this paper you find some of them used a lot in the statistical context. It is no problem to add more: CASI, CSAQ, EDI, XML, XBRL -- all of them and many more will appear in this article (and in the glossary). It is not always easy for statisticians and ICT specialists to understand each other. However, ICT is needed to automate statistical data reporting in order to save resources and improve processes -- so both communities are condemned to co-operate. In this scenario, a third area with yet another jargon is playing an important role, namely e-business: more and more, statistical EDR is using e-business tools and methods, like for example EDIFACT or ebXML. This paper tries to shed some light on the ICT and e-business aspects of statistical data reporting. The questions addressed in this paper include: What is EDR? What is metadata for EDR? Which metadata standards for EDR are available or coming up? And how is the ESS concerned or involved? The current situation of EDI standardisation is examined in more detail: the transition from EDIFACT to XML and the adoption of ebXML for the ESS.;
Examining the Adoption of Extensible Business Reporting Language among Public Listed Companies in Malaysia;This study examines the adoption of an accounting information systems language known as Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) among public listed companies in Malaysia. Using 100 top public listed companies as the sample study, this study examines whether these companies have adopted XBRL, consistent with the call made by the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) for such adoption. Such call was made to encourage listed public companies to provide their annual reports via XBRL and ultimately improves harmonisation between companies and between countries. The result of this study shows that to this date, no public listed companies have adopted XBRL. Such scenario indicates that there could be issues and challenges that have deter the implementation of XBRL among these companies. The result in this study serves as a starting point for CCM and other Malaysian regulators to consider the issues and challenges as to why such scenario exists and subsequently, provide strategies to encourage these companies to adopt XBRL;N
Extensible Business Reporting Language XBRL: Potential of Research in XBRL As a Social Artifact-An Essay;In this brief theoretical narrative, the author intends to present a thought piece which would suggest that study of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is not relevant to technological or financial domains alone. XBRL usage in the World of finance can easily bring out its impact on the society at large through its users in the finance and investment areas. XBRL is simply not a technological artifact alone but has turned into a social artifact. The author, therefore, proposes that future researchers of information systems should also look into the impact of XBRL on the society as a whole. This essay takes a foundational step toward a paradigm and suggests how one might usefully augment further studies with research on XBRL as social artifacts.;N
"Financial Reporting Comparability: Toward an XBRL Ontology of the FASB\&\#47;IFRS Conceptual Framework";As a mechanism for the exchange, transmission, and reporting of accounting and financial data, eXtensible Business Reporting Language XBRL makes great strides toward standardisation. However, given the global nature of contemporary financial markets, XBRL reporting must transcend or accommodate differences in reporting standards. Presently, the two standards for XBRL reporting, the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, make reconciling meanings between these standards a laborious and error-prone affair. As the audience for this reporting often spans countries and cultures, many have a stake in digesting XBRL-formatted financial reports. This paper addresses the question of how cross-cultural and transnational consumers of XBRL statements can derive meaning from these reports. We present an ontological approach toward solving this problem which includes a financial reporting ontology and associated architecture for comparing concepts across XBRL taxonomies. The architecture is explained, evaluation criteria offered, and future research approaches toward realising artefacts using this architecture are proffered.;n
FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS FROM XBRL (EXTENSIBLE BUSINESS REPORTING LANGUAGE) DATA UNDER IPP (PERIOD PUBLIC INFORMATION) TAXONOMY;"The dissertation “Analisis Fundamental en XBRL – Taxonomía IPP “ consists in a web service aimed to ease the access to financial information of companies traded in the Spanish stock market.

In the last few years, advances in technologies of information and computer science have allowed financial information to be shared in a new variety of ways, being XBRL the predominant standard. Because of this, the institutions responsible for guaranteeing the correct behavior of financial markets, as the American SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or the Spanish CNMV (Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores) supply all the relevant financial data under digital format as XBRL reports.";s
Greater Accountability, Less Red Tape: The Australian Standard Business Reporting Experience;Australian governments are early adopters of many electronic record-keeping and reporting systems, and the Australian Standard Business Reporting SBR Program evolves this further. This paper examines the evolution from government-centric technologies and standards to collaborative, open, and community standards-based systems. It describes the SBR Program as a case study in the development of seamless business-to-government reporting, which delivers significant reductions in reporting costs for business. The flexibility and universality of eXtensible Business Reporting Language XBRL is an important element in the SBR approach. The benefits to business and government reveal immediate and practical benefits that expand with the growing number of users of these standards and technologies. The open, collaborative processes that have been driven by the SBR Program are consistent with the current directions of e-government in various countries. Technology in government is interactive and viewed in terms of a complex adaptive system, which needs to grow, respond, and interact with systems used by businesses in the Australian and international communities. The use of XBRL in the SBR Program increases the integrity of data that is provided to multiple parties, eliminating the need to transform financial data in a business's system to the various semantic differences currently imposed.;S

Integrated Reporting: An Opportunity for Australia's Not-for-Profit Sector;Integrated Reporting is a new reporting paradigm that is holistic, strategic, responsive, material and relevant across multiple time frames. Emphasising enhanced disclosure of the value drivers for today's organisations, Integrated Reporting represents a journey to more meaningful reporting that can be instrumental for Australia's reporting organisations, including not-for-profits. With momentum behind the concept of Integrated Reporting building and contemporaneous local regulatory reform on the agenda, there are nascent opportunities for Integrated Reporting to guide the future of not-for-profit reporting in Australia.;N
Interactive financial reporting: an introduction to eXtensible business reporting language (XBRL);As technology provides more efficient and effective methods for financial reporting, students are encouraged to gain experience using these innovations. The SEC and other global financial communities have mandated the use of XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) for certain public filings. The following interactive exercise exposes students to XBRL and provides hands-on experience in using related tools. In Task 1, students learn about the underlying mechanics of XBRL. In Task 2, students use a programmed learning approach to analyze financial information using the SEC’s free interactive financial viewer. Task 3 includes discussion questions related to XBRL and specific accounting courses (i.e., financial, audit, managerial, and systems).;N
INTERNAL REPORTING WITH XBRL GLOBAL LEDGER;hen you think about the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), you probably associate it with the preparation of financial statements.

Issues with the communication and integrity of audit reports when financial reporting shifts to an information-centric paradigm;A core application of XBRL is to facilitate the flow of tagged financial statements and annual reports, from companies and other entities directly to the databases, web sites, and computers of regulators, stakeholders and other information consumers. Increasingly, XBRL provides the technological foundation for the communication of financial information where there is independent assurance. This XBRL-based assurance may be on the financial statements (i.e., an electronically consumable form of today's standard PDF or HTML audit report) or focus on the quality of the XBRL exhibit (i.e., the instance document). Regardless of the type of XBRL assurance report, maintenance of the security and integrity of the instance document is paramount. This conceptual paper identifies and discusses the communication, security challenges and relevant research issues when there is independent assurance on financial statements formatted in XBRL. Successful electronic communication of assurance to information consumers should clearly distinguish the responsibilities of management (i.e., the financial statements) and the auditor (i.e., the audit report). It is important to have an integrated approach where the assurance report, financial statements and other reports in which facts in the financial statements are incorporated are inextricably tied at the level of automated data consumption. Further, as much as possible, human interaction should be accommodated. The paper sets out a range of alternatives for maintenance of security on the assurance report.;N
Managing the Transformation to Standard Business Reporting: Principles and Lessons Learned from the Netherlands;Stricter laws and regulations demand that companies provide business information more timely and accurately to various government agencies. However, this trend increases the administrative burden for companies and the regulatory burden for government agencies. Standard Business Reporting (SBR) is a program that aims to reduce these burdens. Led by government agencies, stakeholders in this program are working towards a national data taxonomy, a single reporting gateway and a secure electronic infrastructure. Anticipated benefits include reduced time and costs for assembling, analyzing and providing business data to government agencies. However, stakeholders face several hurdles that need to be addressed before such benefits can be reaped. Typical hurdles in this transformation include conflicting public and private interests, legal constraints and high security demands. This policy paper presents seven transformation principles gained from the launch of SBR in the Netherlands. The principles are meant to guide stakeholders in proactively dealing with some of the transformation issues that may manifest when launching SBR. While the current scope of SBR is focused on financial reporting, the possibilities for its future application are broader, opening new avenues for digital government research.;S
Organisational Adoption of e-Business: The Case of an Innovation Management Tool at a University and Technology Transfer Office;"While innovation is increasingly attracting the attention of academics and practitioners alike, there is paucity of research investigating the adoption of e-business solutions that support innovation development and commercialisation. Using qualitative evidence that is based on a case study incorporating a focus group and sixteen in-depth interviews across R&D, marketing and administration functions in a mid-sized Australian university and a technology transfer office, we investigate the organisational adoption of an innovation management tool. By applying the technology-organisation-environment framework to an innovation context, this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by enhancing the current understanding of organisational adoption of innovation management tools. Management implications and future research directions are also discussed.

Public Process Management: A Method for Introducing Standard Business Reporting;Businesses have to file many reports to show compliance with rules and regulations. Regulators try to reduce the administrative burden, by providing a standardized representation format and agreements about reporting procedures and the use of technical infrastructure. However, developing and managing such a standardized reporting scheme is hard. It involves inter-dependencies between processes, data and technology and the interests of many stakeholders. Drawing on existing practice this paper presents Public Process Management (PPM): a general method for process management in the public sector. In this paper we apply PPM specifically to the problem of introducing a standardized reporting scheme in an application domain. The method is driven by quality management and process redesign approaches, but deals with unique characteristics of compliance reporting: legal data requirements, provenance, process compliance and multiple stakeholders. In particular, PPM stresses strict adherence to an iterative development schedule, and shared conceptual models of processes, data definitions, technological infrastructure and governance agreements. The usefulness and adequacy of the method are illustrated by a case study on Standard Business Reporting, a standardized reporting channel in the Netherlands for both public and private agencies;
Representing Financial Reports on the Semantic Web: A Faithful Translation from XBRL to OWL;We discuss a translation of financial reports from the XBRL format into the Semantic Web language OWL. Different from existing approaches that do structural translation from XBRL’s XML schema into OWL, our approach can faithfully preserve the implicit semantics in XBRL and enable the logic model of financial reports. We show that such a translation reduces the risk of redundancy and inconsistency, and enables the quick and useful inference on XBRL based financial reports for better business decisions.;N
Stakeholder engagement in internet financial reporting: The diffusion of XBRL in the UK;"Internet financial reporting is now widespread with most medium and large companies in the developed world providing a wide variety of financial data online. However, much of this information mirrors the paper versions of financial reports, often with little attempt to enhance the decision usability of the data, providing a so called ‘first generation’ of online reporting (ICAEW, 2004). eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) has been designed to provide a ‘second generation’ of online reporting, specifically to enhance the usability of the data. Documents rendered in XBRL are digitally-enabled so that it is easier for stakeholders to extract information directly into spreadsheets, or any other XBRL-enabled analysis software, without the need to re-key data thus providing significant improvements in information flows and enhancing inter-company comparability.

XBRL consortia have spent more than 15 years promulgating the use of this technology within the business and government communities. However, despite their efforts XBRL has not become widely diffused, there is little stakeholder engagement and very few organisations have voluntarily adopted XBRL in practice.

The results of a questionnaire survey in the UK indicate that awareness of XBRL, and second generation reporting more generally, resides in key champions but there is little diffusion outside this narrow set of stakeholders. Regulatory engagement seems to be the only impetus for diffusion and better channels of communication within stakeholder networks, such as between regulators, preparers, users and the XBRL community are needed. This paper suggests that currently the supply-push for XBRL is failing to produce effective use of this technology in the UK. Greater regulatory commitment is now needed to create an impetus for XBRL such as creating tools and making publicly available, accessible, repositories of XBRL data. Unless this happens, diffusion will not occur, and the demand-pull which is now needed will vanish and XBRL will fade and die.";
Standard Business Reporting in Australia: efficiency, effectiveness, or both?;The benefits of using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) as a business reporting standard have been widely canvassed in the extant literature, in particular, as the enabling technology for standard business reporting tools. One of the key benefits noted is the ability of standard business reporting to create significant efficiencies in the regulatory reporting process. Efficiency-driven cost reductions are highly desirable by data and report producers. However, they may not have the same potential to create long-term firm value as improved effectiveness of decision making. This study assesses the perceptions of Australian business stakeholders in relation to the benefits of the Australian standard business reporting instantiation (SBR) for financial reporting. These perceptions were drawn from interviews of persons knowledgeable in XBRL-based standard business reporting and submissions to Treasury relative to SBR reporting options. The combination of interviews and submissions permit insights into the views of various groups of stakeholders in relation to the potential benefits. In line with predictions based on a transaction-cost economics perspective, interviewees who primarily came from a data and report-producer background mentioned benefits that centre largely on asset specificity and efficiency. The interviewees who principally came from a data and report-consumer background mentioned benefits that centre on reducing decision-making uncertainty and decision-making effectiveness. The data and report consumers also took a broader view of the benefits of SBR to the financial reporting supply chain. Our research suggests that advocates of SBR have successfully promoted its efficiency benefits to potential users. However, the effectiveness benefits of SBR, for example, the decision-making benefits offered to investors via standardised reports, while becoming more broadly acknowledged, remain not a priority for all stakeholders;S
